<p name="fd7f" id="fd7f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I was testing a piece of software that collected a person’s addresses for shipping within the United States. My developer had tried zip codes in the direct vicinity of our office in Manhattan, which all started with 1. I tried the zip codes for my hometown in New Jersey and the college I attended in Maine, both of which started with 0. Together we determined that the zip codes (and other address fields) needed to be stored differently so leading zeros would not be cut off. But it got me thinking: what other things might occur that were outside the direct experience of me and my developer?</p>

<p name="83bc" id="83bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I asked the internet.</p>

We were constrained to collecting American shipping addresses, so things like “are the odd street numbers all on the same side?” weren’t our concern. But plenty of them were. Was our form going to allow people whose shipping address was any of these?</p>

<p>At my current job in a regulated industry, our software goes through a validation testing period before it goes live. A build is cut. It gets deployed to the validation environment, integrated with our other products. Depending on the size of the product or service, the testers have a few days to a few weeks to generate documentation that describe the features and the environment in case of an audit. Ideally, we’re regression testing during this time. While we continue to look for unexpected behavior, finding anything out of the ordinary means a headache for more people than I care to admit.</p>

<p name="1b2f" id="1b2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I get very worried when I see a regression checklist that involves multiple sheets within the same spreadsheet. I start counting up how long it might take to get through, assuming we don’t have to circle back and investigate, ask questions, or report bugs. I wonder if things have changed since items were added. I wonder who was consulted about which items were high-priority, or necessary. I wonder about what might be assumed about the environment setup, or left off entirely. Rather than building confidence or feeling at peace, multiple spreadsheets of regression scenarios raise my blood pressure.</p>

Raising it was terrifying. This would be the first release of the service, so it was hard for me to tie the bug to customer value. I had to ask a developer to work under extreme time pressure, only to stick myself with the testing of it. Less time to explore meant less confidence after the fix than before. But as a tester, it’s my responsibility to provide relevant information in a timely manner, even if that requires more than my average amount of bravery.</p>

<p name="4fad" id="4fad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">All of the talks I attended at Copenhagen Context included this message: change one thing. Try something, see what happens, and go from there. It’s good advice, but it can be hard when it feels like everything needs changing at once.</p>

Stop fear-based management; consider how people are motivated and compensated. Stop focusing on your process; consider the business value of what you’re building. Stop assuming every problem is a technical problem; look inward when the information you provide isn’t valued. Keith picked on test managers who didn’t do much hands-on testing in particular, which was interesting to hear in a room full of test managers I work for. I heard Keith give this talk a few months ago, but there was enough to take away that I still have two pages of notes (different from the last time) full of new ideas to consider.</p>

Rather than wait for other roles to write a story, Jyothi suggest one thing testers can change: start suggesting requirements. Go to the development architecture meeting. Setup a three amigos meeting. Considering all the things testers can do that aren’t listed in their job description, and you’ll start looking to hire passionate people who can fulfill more that just the requirements.</p>

Rather than shouldering the burden of testing all the products, a small safe-to-fail experiment would give the team enough information to decide if they should proceed. Ash’s talk was about infrastructure testing, and he noted that testers tend to identify infrastructure problems at the wrong level: in the application. If he had to choose one thing to look at to diagnose issues better, it would be production logs.</p>

To improve your process, Helena recommended slowing down and stepping away from your default. By challenging your interpretations and considering other explanations, you can more effectively deal with difficult situations.</p>

It was a pleasure to spend time with my tester friends from around the world. It’s a testament to the hard work of the organizers that there were no duds of presentations, and I missed many worthwhile talks.</p>

<p name="9dc9" id="9dc9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Lately, I’ve been interviewing candidates to join various teams around Medidata. I get resumes full of buzzwords. Each skill is listed with equal confidence and importance. But not all candidates I meet live up to how they appear on paper. Some can’t provide a specific example, or aren’t sure how to explore a product when we’re pair testing. (Frequent listeners of the <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/judge-john-hodgman" data-href="http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/judge-john-hodgman" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Judge John Hodgman podcast</a> will know that <a href="https://twitter.com/romanmars/status/472727849200517120?lang=en" data-href="https://twitter.com/romanmars/status/472727849200517120?lang=en" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">specificity is the soul of narrative</a>.)</p>

<p name="fa3d" id="fa3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve watched candidates confidently proclaim, “No, nothing will happen when I click there” about a website they haven’t touched before. This erodes my trust in their curiosity and their ability to accurately report a bug.</p>

<p name="3b91" id="3b91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I can’t recommend hiring someone who when I say “Huh, I’d expect something to happen when you click there; let’s try it,” isn’t curious enough about what would happen to click there. I don’t expect someone new to a website to know how it works. I only expect them to distinguish between what they’ve explored and what they haven’t. I want them to be able to articulate the circumstances they’ve just experienced, realize that their memory or perception might be fallible, and be clear about what they haven’t yet been able to establish.</p>

<p name="892b" id="892b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Goranka Bjedov spoke about scaling up the hardware in Facebook’s data centers. Her childhood in a power-rationed Yugoslavia makes her an ideal candidate to consider the balance between power and performance and reign in the Silicon Valley dream of just adding another server. (In California and around the world, resources are finite!) On the infrastructure side, Goranka knows she has to plan for features to be massively popular, even when they don’t seem like they’ll take off. Photo tagging and slideshow retrospective videos surpassed her expectations.</p>

<p name="56ce" id="56ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The things she was able to tell about were as interesting as the things she wasn’t. She could tell us the measurements Facebook took on IBM machines a few years ago, but not more recently. IBM was using the data to price the machines! She could tell us how many machines could fit on a rack before the spinning shook it too hard, but she couldn’t tell us how many racks there were in each data center. The data centers use evaporative cooling, literally pools of water on top of the racks, rather than air conditioning to save money. I left thinking “that was all interesting, but when am I going to have input on a data center?” It wasn’t until I got back to the office that I remembered we also host our own data centers. It might be sooner than I thought.</p>

Adam considered examples where humans didn’t accurately evaluate risk. This one stood out to me: Grouping several problems together into one problem underestimates risk.</p>

<blockquote name="ed19" id="ed19" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Integrity is the most important quality we can demonstrate as testers.</blockquote>

<p name="5890" id="5890" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">While it was hard to write unbiased questions, Adam found some interesting results from the questionnaire. Everyone agreed they needed specialist testers, but they didn’t have any on staff at the time! <a href="https://www.riveragency.com/" data-href="https://www.riveragency.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">They’re hiring</a>. <a href="https://www.mdsol.com/en/careers" data-href="https://www.mdsol.com/en/careers" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">So is Medidata</a>.

I appreciated all the follow-up questions in front of the group and individually afterwards.

<p name="89fa" id="89fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I tried to hide for a few minutes because facing the hundreds of people in the lunchroom was too overwhelming after just coming off stage. Unfortunately the interview crew found me! Note for next year: hide in my room and not in the lobby. (Also: find out why people were taking so many desserts.) I missed the beginning of <a href="https://twitter.com/KeithKlain" data-href="https://twitter.com/KeithKlain" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Keith Klain</a>’s talk because I eat a lot. (Get over it.) Apparently, it began with a joke about him being a money launderer that I both originated and plan to perpetuate. The hundreds of Romanians did not appear to be amused. According to sources familiar with the matter, they rarely do.</p>

<p name="86a1" id="86a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Keith noted that testers who can’t connect a bug to the business impact in production are doing it wrong. Publicly traded American companies have series 10 forms outlining their business risks. Both Adam and Keith wanted testers to ask the business what quality meant to them. You can become more efficient by doing less testing if you are transparent with what you’re testing and avoid repeating tests.</p>

<blockquote name="e3fa" id="e3fa" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Testing that adds a lot of value is hard. Good testing raises more questions than it answers.</blockquote>

Until she worked with a tester that caught things she didn’t, she saw testing as a crappy job anyone could do. Like Keith, she saw a lot of redundant testing that didn’t provide value. Now, she wants to work with testers because she sees the unique perspective they can bring to the table. Her growth as a developer reminded me to care about my craft and think about my work without running on auto-pilot.</p>

<blockquote name="956b" id="956b" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Nothing in life is mandatory.</blockquote>

<p name="0e85" id="0e85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Carmen encouraged us to interview candidates for how they work on a team. It’s easier to educate technical skills than social skills. <a href="http://www.huibschoots.nl/wordpress/?p=1666" data-href="http://www.huibschoots.nl/wordpress/?p=1666" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Huib Schoots expanded on how to recognize professional testers in his blog</a>. When I’m interviewing testers to join one of the teams I’m on, I try to ask one question with a straightforward answer I can verify (“What did you talk about with the previous interviewers?”) so I can make sure they describe a situation clearly. I also ask about teamwork or empathy (“Tell me about a time you had to deliver bad news.”)</p>

<p name="a20b" id="a20b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://twitter.com/NicolaO55" data-href="https://twitter.com/NicolaO55" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nicola Owen</a>’s talk posed the question:</p>

<blockquote name="2040" id="2040" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">If you were leaving your job soon, would you test differently?</blockquote>

<p name="30ce" id="30ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">If you’re staying in your job, it can be acceptable for a bug report to need more clarification, or for a colleague to ask you where a document is. Once you’re gone, your abandoned colleagues can’t rely on those valuable conversations. Write things down and put them in an obvious place. Like Carmen, Nicola spoke of developers who’d only had negative experiences with testers. You can show your value by passing on your knowledge before you leave.</p>

<p name="7c09" id="7c09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://twitter.com/hargolas" data-href="https://twitter.com/hargolas" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Harry Girlea</a> spoke last to the entire crowd and really put us all to shame. I can’t imagine telling a bunch of adults about my favorite hobby when I was 12 years old. He handled the Q&amp;A like a pro. When someone asked him how he balanced gaming with school, he said he would probably play too much, but his mom keeps him in check.</p>

<p name="a298" id="a298" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The organizers and volunteers at the conference made the logistics a breeze, which left lots of time for conferring.
