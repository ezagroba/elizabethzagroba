<p name="6c32" id="6c32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I needed to the loading time of a login over a slow network. The internet connection I had was too fast to see all the visual behavior and the backend redirects happening during the process. I opened the Network tab in the Chrome developer tools and switched the throttling option to <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Slow 3G</code>. (A yellow triangular yield symbol appeared next to the Network tab to remind me that I’d throttled my network.) Running over <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Slow 3G</code> allowed me to see what someone trying access the site from a phone or tablet might experience.</p>

<p name="cd6d" id="cd6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The screenshots below are from the login on hackdesign.org, a program I highly recommend for getting up-to-speed on user experience design.</em></p>

<p name="29ea" id="29ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With the Network tab open, I could do a few things:</p>

<ol class="postList">
<li name="8374" id="8374" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">I could see what API calls were being made. I looked at the bottom of the <code class="markup--code markup--li-code">Name</code> column to see how many calls there were overall, and sorted it to discover if we were retrieving things from the server that I expected to be cached. I clicked the <code class="markup--code markup--li-code">Preserve log</code> checkbox before I started so I could see what happened even after I went to another page.</li>
<li name="ef06" id="ef06" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I could see which calls were redirects. The <code class="markup--code markup--li-code">Status</code>column had numbers in the 300 range for redirects. I love<a href="https://httpstatuses.com/" data-href="https://httpstatuses.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> httpstatuses.com</a> for what each one means more precisely. Redirects might indicate something could be optimized.</li>
<li name="6d41" id="6d41" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I could tell how much time each of those network calls took. The <code class="markup--code markup--li-code">Time</code> column allowed me to sort by milliseconds to find the call that took the longest.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="img_container" style="display: inline-block;"><img alt="" src="images/posts/2019/chrome-network-tab.png" style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="What I used in the Network tab of the Chrome developer tools.

HackDesign.org login only took 6 seconds.</span></span></p>
<p name="de62" id="de62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I discovered logging in and logging out took about 20 seconds on the test environment over Slow 3G. (This time appeared in the <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Load</code> text in red at the bottom of the Network tab.) Was this too slow? To answer this question, I needed an oracle.</p>

<p name="7704" id="7704" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I decided to compare the behavior on the test environment to our production environment. On production, login took 60 seconds! When I sorted the network calls by <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Time</code>, I could see that the bulk of loading time was spent retrieving messages to display on the logged-in page. Both 20 and 60 seconds for a login seemed unacceptably slow to me, so I took it to my team.</p>

<p name="d153" id="d153" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My team agreed that this behavior was bad. Unfortunately, we decided to prioritize users on fast networks over users on slow ones, and changing this behavior wasn’t a priority for our release.</p>

<p name="f224" id="f224" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I sorted the network calls by <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Name</code>, I found some unexpected URLs I did not expect to be involved during a login. I tested a bit more around the feature in different places, found a bug in the behavior, and asked around a few different teams before I got the bug reported to the correct team.</p>

<h5 name="d83e" id="d83e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Moral of the story</h5>

<p name="715e" id="715e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing">You have a powerful web performance testing tool at your disposal. Give it a try and see what you find.</p>

<p name="00f1" id="00f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">A few different times, we wrote some Python code to help us test our products. And then we threw the code out.</p>

<p name="ad39" id="ad39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We had the infrastructure in place to add tests to our continuous integration pipeline in Jenkins. It would have been as simple as merging the branch of our code into master. But it had served its purpose already.</p>

<h5 name="7e5f" id="7e5f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Example 1: web feature integrating with desktop software</h5>

<p name="1da2" id="1da2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Our team owner a web-based product. It had lots of features, but the two we were concerned with for this were: it created an account and a project. These would be used in a desktop product built by different teams at our company. For this story, a flag would be set when you created a project in our product to allow for something new in the desktop software.</p>

<p name="9663" id="9663" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our testing stack was built and maintained by our team alone. It was set up to look at the web UI and APIs, but not the desktop software. We had APIs to create projects and change this new project flag. We didn’t have an automated way to see exactly what would happen in the desktop software under these different circumstances.</p>

<p name="c2c2" id="c2c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We wrote tests to query the APIs to see that the settings we set were coming back as expected. Those went into the pipeline. We also wrote some Python code to create projects in each of the five different states. Then, we manually went into the desktop software, used each of the projects we created, and looked at what happened in the desktop software. The information we discovered was enough to determine that the work for our team and the work for the desktop software teams was complete.</p>

<p name="8f6c" id="8f6c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We did not add these tests to the pipeline. The branch got removed from the project without getting merged into master once the story was completed.</p>

<h5 name="5b5e" id="5b5e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Example 2: crude performance test</h5>

<p name="a60d" id="a60d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">We wanted to simulate the load placed on our product by a different internal app. Unfortunately the owner of the internal app was unavailable in the short period of time we had to complete this task. To do this, we took existing feature tests we had running on our staging environments, parallelize them, and run them on a clone of our production environment.</p>

<p name="4cc3" id="4cc3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our production clone was available during the few days we were doing this test. It would not be available thereafter, considering the time and money we would have to invest in maintaining it. Our other staging environments had a different enough capacity that running a performance test there would not be meaningful. Our production environment would give us the information we needed once we released this build because the internal app ran there. We maintained a branch for a few days while we were writing and using the performance test, but without an environment to run it on, we threw it out.</p>

<h5 name="eea5" id="eea5" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Example 3: audit trail Excel export</h5>

<p name="fc7f" id="fc7f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">We added an audit trail to our profile information for GDPR compliance. Our system could display the information in the UI and export it to Excel. We added tests to our pipeline for the UI bit. The exporting to Excel bit we didn’t. We wrote a test that ended by providing us a username and password. Manually, we’d login, go to the page with the Excel export, and confirm that the data in the file matched the changes the test had made.</p>

<p name="c098" id="c098" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Excel exporter wasn’t a piece of code our team maintained. If this test failed, it would have likely been in that functionality, since we also had a UI test for the data integrity. We weren’t changing anything about the Excel export. The audit trail report was an important enough feature that we knew we’d smoke test it manually with every release, so we didn’t add this code to the repository.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="images/posts/2019/windows.png"></p>
<h5 name="a30f" id="a30f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">What we asked ourselves when throwing out our automation</h5>

<ul class="postList">
<li name="a1f8" id="a1f8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4">What would we be asserting at the end of the test?</li>
<li name="5de9" id="5de9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">If those asserts succeeded, would they give us false confidence that the feature was covered when we couldn’t account for the consequences?</li>
<li name="f15d" id="f15d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">If these asserts failed, would that give us information about what to fix in our product?</li>
<li name="90cc" id="90cc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Would checking the code into the automation repository expose sensitive data about production?</li>
<li name="2a56" id="2a56" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing">Would running these tests against our staging environments give us the information we needed?</li>

<p name="af15" id="af15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">My first job after college was with a contractor to the United States Navy. I had to get a security clearance from the U.S. government to have access to classified data, the lowest category. One piece of the application was getting fingerprinted. From there, federal agencies like the FBI would check my fingerprints against criminal records databases to see if any matches turned up.</p>

<p name="7241" id="7241" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I walked down to the local police station in my college town of Waterville, Maine, which is not exactly a bustling metropolis. I expected a police officer to compare my picture on the driver’s license I’d brought with my actual face to confirm my identity, before taking my fingerprints and shipping them off to the appropriate authority.</p>

<p name="0ffc" id="0ffc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But they did not.</p>

<p><span class="img_container" style="display: inline-block;"><img alt="" src="images/posts/2019/fingerprints.jpeg" style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="flickr/cogdog"><span class="img_caption" style="display: block; text-align: center;">flickr/cogdog</span></span></p>
<p name="f72c" id="f72c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">First, when I arrived at the station, I was told to wait. “We’re questioning a suspect in the booking room!” This was clearly the most action these officers had seen in a while. They were psyched. But I was puzzled about why this was an impediment, so naturally I asked more questions: “Can you tell me more about the ink pad? Is it secured to the table in some fashion? Would it be possible to continue questioning the subject, but take my fingerprints out here in the hallway?”</p>

<p name="8262" id="8262" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After explaining this to two different officers and lots more waiting, they discovered that the ink pad was indeed able to be transported by human hands to interact with mine. They filled out the form with my name and some other details I provided verbally and took my fingerprints. I left.</p>

<p name="adeb" id="adeb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was only after I got back to campus that I realized the crucial step the police officers missed: they forgot to look at my driver’s license. They were so thrown off from their usual routine, both by having a suspect in custody and by moving the fingerprint pad to a different location, that they forgot to verify my identity.</p>

<p name="6e0d" id="6e0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have no criminal record, I was only at the job for a short time, and my security clearance expired after five years without getting renewed, so the mistake was of no consequence.</p>

<p name="6b10" id="6b10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But consider the alternative: I have a criminal record. I send my sister or a friend who knew enough about me to the police station. They impersonate me, and the fingerprint check of their prints turns up no suspicious activity. Now I have security clearance to access classified data about the American military when I shouldn’t.</p>

<p name="e1e9" id="e1e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The moral of this story: authentication and authorization go hand-in-hand. Authorization could have been circumvented by an unauthorized impersonator without the additional check of authentication. Putting someone in a particular security group is not enough: you’ve got to check that it’s them who’s supposed to be there.</p>

If you’re one of the lucky few to get invited, you find yourself in an environment surrounded by the best and the brightest. There will be presentations to spark a discussion, but the facilitated discussion is where the real learning occurs. It certainly puts the “confer” back in conference.</p>

<p name="3a66" id="3a66" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Dutch Exploratory Workshop on Testing (or DEWT for short, rhymes with newt) in the fall of 2018 was the first one of these I attended outside of work. The theme was “Developing expertise in software testing.” The format of the gathering itself paired nicely with one of the main conclusions I took away from the weekend: choose the best people, foster an environment where they have the energy to learn and inspire others, and set aside time to reflect.</p>

<p name="05d9" id="05d9" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Here are some of the things I think about at least once a week back at work:</p>
<blockquote name="64ce" id="64ce" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You let people annoy you by not pushing back.”</blockquote>
<p name="bc0e" id="bc0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">People cannot read your mind. If something is bothering you and you never bring it up, how are they supposed to figure it out? Try to find something small to be firm about, and build from there.</p>
<blockquote name="b78d" id="b78d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“People relax when you say it’s time-boxed.”</blockquote>
<p name="0706" id="0706" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Sometimes I’d rather stop fighting than win. I think it’s clear that a bug should be investigated, but someone else believes it’s not worth any time. Instead of deciding yes or no based on insufficient information, I’ve found “let’s look at this for two hours and decide if we should keep going” gets more people on board and allows the conversation to move on.</p>
<blockquote name="1d71" id="1d71" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“When you ask a difficult question, sometimes people ask a simpler question in their head and answer that.”</blockquote>
<p name="de86" id="de86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing">One of the questions I was trying to help answer this week was “should we release next week?” The team and I found it easier to answer adjacent questions instead of the big one we needed. We could find answers to “are there pieces of work we need to complete before the release?”, “are those pieces of work estimated?”, “could the tests that aren’t passing expose risk to our company’s bottom line?”. I can see how some of the answers to these smaller questions can support an answer to the larger one. My worry is that getting “yes, this is fine” to something small will accidentally result in a “yes, this is fine” to the overall question.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR; You can copy <a href="https://github.com/ezagroba/bash-profile-branch-and-color/blob/master/export-PS1.gist">all the code from my github</a>.</strong></p>
<p name="0fd7" id="0fd7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I spent the better part of a crafting day at the office updating my <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">.bash_profile</code> on my Mac. If I’m in a git repository, with every command prompt, I see the branch name and an asterisk if there are un-committed changes. The original prompt for the machine, the repository name, and the branch name each appear in different colors. Here’s what it looks like:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="images/posts/2019/command-prompt.png"></p>
<p name="47d3" id="47d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It may look like this one line in my <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">.bash_profile</code> file is where the magic happens, because this is where the colors are set:</p>

<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">PS1</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"\[\033[36m\]\u\[\033[32m\]\w\[\033[33m\]\$(git_branch)\$(parse_git_dirty)\[\033[00m\]</span>$<span class="s2">"</span>
</code></pre>


<p><img alt="" src="images/posts/2019/colors.png"></p>
<p name="c9ba" id="c9ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Unfortunately the colors, branch, and status still need to be variously activated and calculated.

</p>
<p>This function calculates if the branch has new changes:</p>


<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">parse_git_dirty</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="p">[[</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">n</span> <span class="s2">"$(git status -s2&gt; /dev/null)"</span> <span class="p">]]</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nx">echo</span> <span class="s2">"*"</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>



<p name="b7b9" id="b7b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The last thing is fetching the branch name:</p>


<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code>git_branch<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  git branch <span class="m">2</span>&gt; /dev/null <span class="p">|</span> sed -e <span class="s1">'/^[^*]/d'</span> -d <span class="s1">'s/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/'</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre>



<p name="5ccd" id="5ccd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It took a lot of internet searching and help from colleagues to set it up. I had the git status and the branch name going separately, but combining them failed. Typing past the width of the window in the command prompt would send text to overwrite the current line instead of wrapping onto a second. <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/24358/how-do-i-get-long-command-lines-to-wrap-to-the-next-line" data-href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/24358/how-do-i-get-long-command-lines-to-wrap-to-the-next-line" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">This solved that for me</a>. <a href="http://jafrog.com/2013/11/23/colors-in-terminal.html" data-href="http://jafrog.com/2013/11/23/colors-in-terminal.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">There are also other color options</a>. The slashes <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">\</code> help end commands, but it was a lot of trial and error to get them all in the right spots. I was editing my <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">.bash_profile</code> intially in Sublime; any plain-text editor would have worked. I moved to nano in the Terminal when I wanted to see the changes more quickly. I did still have to close all open Terminal sessions before seeing the latest changes.</p>
<p name="fb1a" id="fb1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This lovely command prompt doesn’t prevent every mistake, but it does help call my attention to the status so I don’t:</p>

<p name="fd7f" id="fd7f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I was testing a piece of software that collected a person’s addresses for shipping within the United States. My developer had tried zip codes in the direct vicinity of our office in Manhattan, which all started with 1. I tried the zip codes for my hometown in New Jersey and the college I attended in Maine, both of which started with 0. Together we determined that the zip codes (and other address fields) needed to be stored differently so leading zeros would not be cut off. But it got me thinking: what other things might occur that were outside the direct experience of me and my developer?</p>

<p name="83bc" id="83bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I asked the internet.</p>

<p name="cf4f" id="cf4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s when I first came across <a href="https://www.mjt.me.uk/posts/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-addresses/" data-href="https://www.mjt.me.uk/posts/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-addresses/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Falsehoods programmers believe about addresses</a>. We were constrained to collecting American shipping addresses, so things like “are the odd street numbers all on the same side?” weren’t our concern. But plenty of them were. Was our form going to allow people whose shipping address was any of these?</p>

<p>At my current job in a regulated industry, our software goes through a validation testing period before it goes live. A build is cut. It gets deployed to the validation environment, integrated with our other products. Depending on the size of the product or service, the testers have a few days to a few weeks to generate documentation that describe the features and the environment in case of an audit. Ideally, we’re regression testing during this time. While we continue to look for unexpected behavior, finding anything out of the ordinary means a headache for more people than I care to admit.</p>

<p name="1b2f" id="1b2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I get very worried when I see a regression checklist that involves multiple sheets within the same spreadsheet. I start counting up how long it might take to get through, assuming we don’t have to circle back and investigate, ask questions, or report bugs. I wonder if things have changed since items were added. I wonder who was consulted about which items were high-priority, or necessary. I wonder about what might be assumed about the environment setup, or left off entirely. Rather than building confidence or feeling at peace, multiple spreadsheets of regression scenarios raise my blood pressure.</p>

I had to ask a developer to work under extreme time pressure, only to stick myself with the testing of it. Less time to explore meant less confidence after the fix than before. But as a tester, it’s my responsibility to provide relevant information in a timely manner, even if that requires more than my average amount of bravery.</p>

Stop fear-based management; consider how people are motivated and compensated. Stop focusing on your process; consider the business value of what you’re building. Stop assuming every problem is a technical problem; look inward when the information you provide isn’t valued. Keith picked on test managers who didn’t do much hands-on testing in particular, which was interesting to hear in a room full of test managers I work for. I heard Keith give this talk a few months ago, but there was enough to take away that I still have two pages of notes (different from the last time) full of new ideas to consider.</p>

Rather than wait for other roles to write a story, Jyothi suggest one thing testers can change: start suggesting requirements. Go to the development architecture meeting. Setup a three amigos meeting. Considering all the things testers can do that aren’t listed in their job description, and you’ll start looking to hire passionate people who can fulfill more that just the requirements.</p>

<p name="9f7e" id="9f7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I spoke about being an introvert. This seemed to be the biggest takeaway from the talk, which luckily is something you can change:</p>

Rather than shouldering the burden of testing all the products, a small safe-to-fail experiment would give the team enough information to decide if they should proceed. Ash’s talk was about infrastructure testing, and he noted that testers tend to identify infrastructure problems at the wrong level: in the application. If he had to choose one thing to look at to diagnose issues better, it would be production logs.</p>

To improve your process, Helena recommended slowing down and stepping away from your default. By challenging your interpretations and considering other explanations, you can more effectively deal with difficult situations.</p>

When people gave her advice and templates to direct her, she realized she had no credibility and she needed to change one thing instead of changing all the things.</p>

<p name="3f28" id="3f28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m so grateful for the time I got to spend learning from the speakers and attendees at Copenhagen Context. It was a pleasure to spend time with my tester friends from around the world. It’s a testament to the hard work of the organizers that there were no duds of presentations, and I missed many worthwhile talks.</p>

<p name="01a4" id="01a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Back at the office this week, I resolved to change one thing: I want to get better at sharing knowledge with my colleagues. What’s the one thing you’re going to change?</p>

On the infrastructure side, Goranka knows she has to plan for features to be massively popular, even when they don’t seem like they’ll take off. Photo tagging and slideshow retrospective videos surpassed her expectations.</p>

<p name="56ce" id="56ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The things she was able to tell about were as interesting as the things she wasn’t. She could tell us the measurements Facebook took on IBM machines a few years ago, but not more recently. IBM was using the data to price the machines! She could tell us how many machines could fit on a rack before the spinning shook it too hard, but she couldn’t tell us how many racks there were in each data center. The data centers use evaporative cooling, literally pools of water on top of the racks, rather than air conditioning to save money. I left thinking “that was all interesting, but when am I going to have input on a data center?” It wasn’t until I got back to the office that I remembered we also host our own data centers. It might be sooner than I thought.</p>

Adam considered examples where humans didn’t accurately evaluate risk. This one stood out to me: Grouping several problems together into one problem underestimates risk.</p>

<p name="5890" id="5890" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">While it was hard to write unbiased questions, Adam found some interesting results from the questionnaire. Everyone agreed they needed specialist testers, but they didn’t have any on staff at the time! <a href="https://www.riveragency.com/" data-href="https://www.riveragency.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">They’re hiring</a>. <a href="https://www.mdsol.com/en/careers" data-href="https://www.mdsol.com/en/careers" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">So is Medidata</a>. We build software for clinical trials at Medidata. I think we have a very low tolerance for bugs in production, but more flexibility around scope and deadlines. Adam got me curious about whether our business leaders would agree.</p>

<p name="8fd6" id="8fd6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I spoke next! Sanda and Raluca kept me calm before I went on. <a href="https://www.stefanfekete.com/" data-href="https://www.stefanfekete.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stefan</a> managed to capture photographic evidence of <a href="https://medium.com/@ezagroba" data-href="https://medium.com/@ezagroba" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">my face</a> looking normal. I’m grateful for everyone who came and sat scattered among the rows by themselves, or was eager to engage with me afterwards. <a href="https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/lessons/succeeding-as-an-introvert-elizabeth-zagroba" data-href="https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/lessons/succeeding-as-an-introvert-elizabeth-zagroba" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here’s a previous but similar performance if you’re curious</a>. I appreciated all the follow-up questions in front of the group and individually afterwards. In future performances, I need to do a better job of noting that no one’s an introvert all the time, and the extrovert/introvert distinction isn’t going to be useful for everyone.</p>

<p name="89fa" id="89fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I tried to hide for a few minutes because facing the hundreds of people in the lunchroom was too overwhelming after just coming off stage. Unfortunately the interview crew found me! Note for next year: hide in my room and not in the lobby. (Also: find out why people were taking so many desserts.) I missed the beginning of <a href="https://twitter.com/KeithKlain" data-href="https://twitter.com/KeithKlain" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Keith Klain</a>’s talk because I eat a lot. (Get over it.) Apparently, it began with a joke about him being a money launderer that I both originated and plan to perpetuate. The hundreds of Romanians did not appear to be amused. According to sources familiar with the matter, they rarely do.</p>

<p name="86a1" id="86a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Keith noted that testers who can’t connect a bug to the business impact in production are doing it wrong. Publicly traded American companies have series 10 forms outlining their business risks. Both Adam and Keith wanted testers to ask the business what quality meant to them. You can become more efficient by doing less testing if you are transparent with what you’re testing and avoid repeating tests.</p>

<blockquote name="e3fa" id="e3fa" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Testing that adds a lot of value is hard. Good testing raises more questions than it answers.</blockquote>

<p name="c398" id="c398" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carmen-sighiartau-a360236a/" data-href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carmen-sighiartau-a360236a/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Carmen Sighiartau</a> spoke about testing from a developer’s perspective. Until she worked with a tester that caught things she didn’t, she saw testing as a crappy job anyone could do. Like Keith, she saw a lot of redundant testing that didn’t provide value. Now, she wants to work with testers because she sees the unique perspective they can bring to the table. Her growth as a developer reminded me to care about my craft and think about my work without running on auto-pilot.</p>

<blockquote name="956b" id="956b" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Nothing in life is mandatory.</blockquote>

<p name="0e85" id="0e85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Carmen encouraged us to interview candidates for how they work on a team. It’s easier to educate technical skills than social skills. <a href="http://www.huibschoots.nl/wordpress/?p=1666" data-href="http://www.huibschoots.nl/wordpress/?p=1666" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Huib Schoots expanded on how to recognize professional testers in his blog</a>. When I’m interviewing testers to join one of the teams I’m on, I try to ask one question with a straightforward answer I can verify (“What did you talk about with the previous interviewers?”) so I can make sure they describe a situation clearly. I also ask about teamwork or empathy (“Tell me about a time you had to deliver bad news.”)</p>

<p name="a20b" id="a20b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://twitter.com/NicolaO55" data-href="https://twitter.com/NicolaO55" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nicola Owen</a>’s talk posed the question:</p>

<blockquote name="2040" id="2040" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">If you were leaving your job soon, would you test differently?</blockquote>

<p name="30ce" id="30ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">If you’re staying in your job, it can be acceptable for a bug report to need more clarification, or for a colleague to ask you where a document is. Once you’re gone, your abandoned colleagues can’t rely on those valuable conversations. Write things down and put them in an obvious place. Like Carmen, Nicola spoke of developers who’d only had negative experiences with testers. You can show your value by passing on your knowledge before you leave.</p>

<p name="7c09" id="7c09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://twitter.com/hargolas" data-href="https://twitter.com/hargolas" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Harry Girlea</a> spoke last to the entire crowd and really put us all to shame. I can’t imagine telling a bunch of adults about my favorite hobby when I was 12 years old. He handled the Q&amp;A like a pro. When someone asked him how he balanced gaming with school, he said he would probably play too much, but his mom keeps him in check.</p>

<p name="a298" id="a298" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The organizers and volunteers at the conference made the logistics a breeze, which left lots of time for conferring. Thanks in particular to <a href="https://twitter.com/Rob_Lambert" data-href="https://twitter.com/Rob_Lambert" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rob Lambert</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ard_kramer" data-href="https://twitter.com/ard_kramer" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ard Kramer</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/EnquireTST" data-href="https://twitter.com/EnquireTST" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Beren Van Daele</a> for lending me their ears. I appreciate all the ideas and I hope I have the opportunity to join this wonderful group again in the future!</p>
