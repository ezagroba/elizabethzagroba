<p>When you say no to what you don't have the energy for, you leave your time, attention, and devotion free to pursue what keeps you energized. Through a tumult of plans and dreams that only 2020 could continue to crush, the Agile Testing Days crew put on a revitalizing conference. I only caught a glimpse of the preparation that went into providing a top-notch experience for speakers and participants, and I have to commend the group on their commitment to the cause. Bravo.</p>
<p>The talks were recorded. I've decided to cut myself off on catching up on missed talks after two weeks. Reflecting on what wisdom I've garned from a small subset of the offerings at Agile Testing Days will be more valuable than being exposed to every last word. In that spirit, let me give you a few takeaways in place of an exhaustive recap or analysis. </p>
<p>Parveen Khan: watch this if you're looking to collaborate</p>
<ul>
<li>It is in doing the work that we discover what we must do. </li>
<li>Don't get stuck when learning something alone; pair. </li>
</ul>
<p>João Proença: watch this if you need a different direction</p>
<ul>
<li>Performing a health check and making a diagnosis are different skills. </li>
<li>What barriers do we set for ourselves?</li>
<li>The product is all the pieces the customers see, including the cloud infrastructure (and whatever else your team isn't responsible for). </li>
</ul>
<p>Paul Holland &amp; Huib Schoots: watch this if your automation isn't providing valuable information</p>
<ul>
<li>The sunk cost fallacy means we're unlikely to get rid of automation code, even if it's ineffective.</li>
<li>We often fail at getting people to change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gitte Kligaard talk: watch this if you've been hiding your true self at work</p>
<ul>
<li>"I'm just going to rewind." (Possibly my favorite takeaway from this conference, I'm going to use this anytime I trip over my words.)</li>
<li>Creativity comes when inspired by others.</li>
<li>Being professional is knowing your craft, and admitting when you don't know.</li>
<li>Spend time with yourself to listen to yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alex Schladebeck &amp; Ashley Hunsberger: no recording, but follow these ladies on Twitter for how to balance life and leadership</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell people what you want. They may be able to help you.</li>
<li>Have a clear vision of what you want.</li>
<li>Write down your fear. Ask yourself: Why is this positive? How can I build the courage to do this?</li>
<li>Be explicit about what you're doing.</li>
<li>Show how you're working.</li>
<li>Build a practice of reflection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Angie Jones: watch this if you need a push to get into automation</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine your goal first. If you don't know it, you'll definitely fail.</li>
<li>When you're a leader, celebrate the small victories. </li>
<li>There's no reason to shame people for being creative and doing the best they can.</li>
<li>It's not realistic to assume master level by default.</li>
<li>Find out why developers don't participate in automation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rob Meaney: watch this if you don't get why observability is important</p>
<ul>
<li>We learn profound lessons from painful experiences.</li>
<li>Build relationships. Influence people at the right time.</li>
<li>Pain + reflection =&gt; progress</li>
<li>It doesn't matter how much we test a thing if nobody wants to use it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tobias Geyer: watch this if you're struggling with an ethical dilemna </p>
<ul>
<li>Could ethics be a non-functional requirement?</li>
<li>Read the codes of ethics proposed by the IEEE, ISTQB, ACM, and James Bach.</li>
<li>A hippocrattic oath for software testing: avoid harm.</li>
<li>Promote environment sustainability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Smita Mishra: watch this if you're interviewing users </p>
<ul>
<li>Listen to be able to ask clarifying questions and dig deeper. </li>
<li>Ask users: their objective, what they found, about the impact, where they're struggling, what could make their lives easier.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eveline Moolenaars: watch this if you're learning to coach</p>
<ul>
<li>"We have a policy; it's somewhere on the internet" isn't enough.</li>
<li>"Everyone deserves a coach to make them aware of what they've forgotten." ~Brad Gilbert</li>
</ul>
<p>Federico Toledo: watch this if you or those around you are losing steam</p>
<ul>
<li>A tester with a sense of purpose is more resilient.</li>
<li>Focus on strengths more than weaknesses, turning up the good. </li>
<li>Provide visibility that you're doing something with the feedback.</li>
<li>Ask people if they're getting what they need.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nicola Sedgwick: watch this if you're the gatekeeper for quality</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not correlate your own successes with the quality of the entire system.</li>
<li>Contract-driven work is not holistic quality.</li>
<li>Report when there has been no progress.</li>
<li>Ask for a code walk-through before a build is ready.</li>
<li>Shift quality left all the way to the executive team.</li>
<li>Testers were hoarding responsibility for quality. Let it go.</li>
</ul>
<p>Joep Schuurkes: watch this if (or while) you're stuck in an ineffective meeting</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask yourself: is my work inside or outside of meetings?</li>
<li>Get the right group of people in the room before holding a meeting.</li>
<li>Express specific appreciations for things done well so people will keep doing them.</li>
<li>Meetings are synchornous collaboration with a purpose.</li>
<li>Standups should remove impediments.</li>
<li>The metaphors we choose say something about how we feel about our work.</li>
<li>Leadership is creating an environment where everyone can contribute to solving a problem. ~Jerry Weinberg</li>
</ul>
<p>Clare Norman: watch this if you're truly stuck</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality is everyone's care.</li>
<li>"Success is liking who you are, what you do, and how you do it." ~Maya Angelou</li>
<li>Your courage quota for the day might vary. </li>
<li>You don't get better by doing the same thing everyday. </li>
<li>I didn't know how I needed to be helped.</li>
<li>You can't drag someone through time.</li>
<li>We live far less in the present than we ought to.</li>
<li>How magical is it when people value the change that you're making?</li>
<li>Passion spreads when other people share in your excitement.</li>
<li>Have a cheerleader in your life.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="img_container" style="display: inline-block;"><img alt="" src="../../../images/posts/2020/success.png" style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Clare Norman channeling Maya Angelou on success"><span class="img_caption" style="display: block; text-align: center;">Clare Norman channeling Maya Angelou on success</span></span></p>
<p>Jenny Bramble: watch this if your tests are failing on expected behavior</p>
<ul>
<li>Many defects I filed are never fixed. Unfixed defects become expected behavior.</li>
<li>Automation has never found a defect. Automation tells us behavior has changed. </li>
<li>Tests should pass on expected behavior, including some defects.</li>
<li>Document your tests for others, including your future self.</li>
</ul>
<p>James Lyndsay &amp; Anne Colder: watch this if you feel like an impostor </p>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledge when you can't help.</li>
<li>If you could take one step forward, what would you do?</li>
<li>Talk to your person, or ask a smaller group of people if they have an answer to your problem. </li>
<li>Forgiveness is one of the most powerful things you can do as a human being.</li>
<li>After you make a mistake: wallow in it (really feel it first), forgive yourself, then dance.</li>
<li>Your job title allows other people to figure out how to work with you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gitte Klitgaard AMA: watch this if you miss the hallway track</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen to hear what's being said, not to respond. </li>
<li>We can't read minds.</li>
<li>Creating a safe space allows you to feel uncomfortable. </li>
<li>Silence is a tool. </li>
</ul>
<p>Sophie Küster: watch this if you're ready to tell your colleagues your big secret</p>
<ul>
<li>There is strength in showing vulnerability.</li>
<li>People want to help you. Let them. </li>
<li>Ask yourself: how am I treating myself?</li>
<li>Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly. Poorly done is better than not done at all. </li>
</ul>
<p>Gitte Klitgaard &amp; Morgan Ahlström: watch this if you want to get psychological safety in the boardroom and on the roadmap</p>
<ul>
<li>Make time to address psychological safety. Put it on the same level in your team's goals as your product goals. </li>
<li>We are role models. We lead by example.</li>
<li>More people were uncomfortable giving than receiving code reviews. </li>
</ul>
<p>Ard Kramer: watch this if you're getting burned out</p>
<ul>
<li>Humans have an unrealitic belief in our own influence. </li>
<li>Performing your testing role doesn't make you popular. </li>
<li>Most people looking for confirmation that the software is working. To form a logical proof, we look for evidence that the software doesn't work. </li>
<li>Ask yourself: which circumstances could I control? Did I manage expectations correctly? </li>
</ul>
<p>I'm grateful I got to connect with people who keep me going. I'm grateful Agile Testing Days tried to make this work in person. I'm grateful I was able to drop my workshop instead of abaondoning people in breakout rooms to do something they've never done before. I'm grateful the mobbing session I helped organize and facilitate went smoothly. I'm grateful that my job allows me the time and space to be rejunivated by this all. I'm grateful. 🙏</p>
