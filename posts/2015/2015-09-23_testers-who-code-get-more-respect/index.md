<p name="c093" id="c093" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The debate-style “Should Testers Code?” presentation at CAST 2015 was one of the best attended talks of the conference. And with good reason: This question is everywhere. But after more than an hour of <a href="https://twitter.com/henkeandersson" data-href="https://twitter.com/henkeandersson" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Henrik Andersson</a> defending testers who don’t code and <a href="https://twitter.com/chzy" data-href="https://twitter.com/chzy" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jeff Morgan</a> defending testers who do code, I was convinced. Everyone should stop asking this question.</p><p name="477c" id="477c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Yes. Testers should know how to code.</strong></p><p name="299c" id="299c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At CAST, Jeff Morgan boiled it down to this: testers who can code are more flexible. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">There is a larger, more diverse market for their skills</strong>. <a href="http://testobsessed.com/2010/10/testers-code/" data-href="http://testobsessed.com/2010/10/testers-code/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Elizabeth Hendrickson found this by counting job descriptions</a>. Testers who can code serve their teams in more ways and jump in to solve problems and ask questions that only a developer can. <a href="http://thesocialtester.co.uk/why-testers-really-should-learn-to-code/" data-href="http://thesocialtester.co.uk/why-testers-really-should-learn-to-code/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rob Lambert argues that you need coding or some other niche to get a testing job</a>. <a href="http://www.ministryoftesting.com/2014/02/testers-coding-debate-can-move-now/" data-href="http://www.ministryoftesting.com/2014/02/testers-coding-debate-can-move-now/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Paul Gerrard notes that adding more skills to your repertoire can only add to your knowledge, not subtract</a>. A skilled tester can put on many hats — user, business analyst, client — and adding developer to that mix can help.</p><p name="b31e" id="b31e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Testers who can code are treated with respect by their developers</strong>.</p><p name="9410" id="9410" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://medium.com/@marlenac/a-tableflip-guide-transitioning-from-tester-to-developer-f09f3c79f25a" data-href="https://medium.com/@marlenac/a-tableflip-guide-transitioning-from-tester-to-developer-f09f3c79f25a" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">Marlena Compton worries that individuals with less power have been pushed into testing rather than development</a>. <a href="http://www.developsense.com/blog/2011/09/at-least-three-good-reasons-for-testers-to-learn-to-program/" data-href="http://www.developsense.com/blog/2011/09/at-least-three-good-reasons-for-testers-to-learn-to-program/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Michael Bolton notes that a tester’s empathy grows when they are able to gain a greater insight into the software environment and the problems developers face</a>.</p><p name="1e5b" id="1e5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Testers are constantly asking themselves if the task they’re performing is providing a higher value than some other task. A tester who can code has one more tool in their tool belt to help eliminate bottlenecks along the way. When a tester has the engineering skills to craft an automated suite of checks, they’re often able to provide more value to their team than a tester checking the same boxes manually.</p><p name="23e2" id="23e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For all these reasons, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">they make more money.</strong></p><p name="94f7" id="94f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">More interesting work, more respect, and more money: What more do you want?</p></div></div></section>
