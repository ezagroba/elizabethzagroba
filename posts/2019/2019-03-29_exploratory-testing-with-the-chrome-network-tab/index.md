<p name="6c32" id="6c32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I needed to the loading time of a login over a slow network. The internet connection I had was too fast to see all the visual behavior and the backend redirects happening during the process. I opened the Network tab in the Chrome developer tools and switched the throttling option to <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Slow 3G</code>. (A yellow triangular yield symbol appeared next to the Network tab to remind me that I’d throttled my network.) Running over <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Slow 3G</code> allowed me to see what someone trying access the site from a phone or tablet might experience.</p><p name="cd6d" id="cd6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The screenshots below are from the login on hackdesign.org, a program I highly recommend for getting up-to-speed on user experience design.</em></p><p name="29ea" id="29ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With the Network tab open, I could do a few things:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="8374" id="8374" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">I could see what API calls were being made. I looked at the bottom of the <code class="markup--code markup--li-code">Name</code> column to see how many calls there were overall, and sorted it to discover if we were retrieving things from the server that I expected to be cached. I clicked the <code class="markup--code markup--li-code">Preserve log</code> checkbox before I started so I could see what happened even after I went to another page.</li><li name="ef06" id="ef06" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I could see which calls were redirects. The <code class="markup--code markup--li-code">Status</code>column had numbers in the 300 range for redirects. I love<a href="https://httpstatuses.com/" data-href="https://httpstatuses.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> httpstatuses.com</a> for what each one means more precisely. Redirects might indicate something could be optimized.</li><li name="6d41" id="6d41" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I could tell how much time each of those network calls took. The <code class="markup--code markup--li-code">Time</code> column allowed me to sort by milliseconds to find the call that took the longest.</li></ol>

<p name="de62" id="de62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I discovered logging in and logging out took about 20 seconds on the test environment over Slow 3G. (This time appeared in the <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Load</code> text in red at the bottom of the Network tab.) Was this too slow? To answer this question, I needed an oracle.</p><p name="7704" id="7704" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I decided to compare the behavior on the test environment to our production environment. On production, login took 60 seconds! When I sorted the network calls by <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Time</code>, I could see that the bulk of loading time was spent retrieving messages to display on the logged-in page. Both 20 and 60 seconds for a login seemed unacceptably slow to me, so I took it to my team.</p><p name="d153" id="d153" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My team agreed that this behavior was bad. Unfortunately, we decided to prioritize users on fast networks over users on slow ones, and changing this behavior wasn’t a priority for our release.</p><p name="f224" id="f224" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I sorted the network calls by <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Name</code>, I found some unexpected URLs I did not expect to be involved during a login. I tested a bit more around the feature in different places, found a bug in the behavior, and asked around a few different teams before I got the bug reported to the correct team.</p><h4 name="d83e" id="d83e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Moral of the story</h4><p name="715e" id="715e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing">You have a powerful web performance testing tool at your disposal. Give it a try and see what you find.</p></div></div></section>
