### Bio

Elizabeth is Quality Lead at [Mendix](https://www.mendix.com/) in Rotterdam. She reviews and contributes code to a Python test automation repository for 15+ teams building Mendix apps across three units. She builds exploratory testing skills by asking pointed questions throughout the unit, facilitating workshops, and coordinating an ensemble (mob) testing practice. She injects what she learns from conferences, books, and meetups into her daily work, and spreads her knowledge through the company-wide Agile guild she facilitates. She's presented at conferences throughout North America and Europe, and co-organizes the Friends of Good Software conference ([FroGS conf](http://frogsconf.nl/)). 

She coaches people to success when possible, but isn't afraid to direct when necessary. She's the go-to person for things like supporting new presenters, reviewing documentation, navigating tricky organizational questions, and thinking critically about what we're building. Her goal is to guide enough testers, leads, etc. to make herself redundant so she can take on new and bigger challenges. 

You can find Elizabeth's big thoughts on this blog and little thoughts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ezagroba).
