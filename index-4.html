<p>After years of envying the tweets and stories from SoCraTes conferences, this cursèd disease finally made attending one possible. I could afford the time (part of one day, instead of a whole weekend + travel) and the cost (£2.50, instead of €€€). </p>
<p>I'm preparing to host an open space of our own in September (<a href="http://testcraftcamp.nl/">TestCraftCamp</a>, tickets are free!), so aside from the sessions, I was also interested in the infrastructure of the event. The hosts hung out in one central Zoom room (a one-month subscription cost them £10). Each attendee was appointed co-host, allowing us to move around among the many breakout rooms as we pleased. (There may have been as many breakout rooms as there were participants, named with varying levels of creativity but functionally the same.) A <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> board captured the user-generated schedule, along with links to the <a href="https://www.mural.co/">Mural</a> whiteboards the organizers created for each room, rather than for each session. Chat happened in a <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> channel, but <a href="https://twitter.com/ezagroba/status/1287372791168278529">I wouldn't recommend it</a>. </p>
<p>The first session I attended was a discussion about the value and hazards of leaving a job. First: decide where you want to go, what kind of thing you're looking for. You're not going to get where you want to go by running away from your current role. Run <em>towards</em> something. Have honest conversations with your peers, manager, mentor, coach, etc. about what change you can affect at the organization. (Things like the nature of the product, the tech stack, or the customer base are unlikely to change quickly.) If you do decide to change jobs, it will take a lot of energy to find something new and build your network at the new place. You may have to prove yourself all over again, and solve the problems you've already solved with this different group of people. </p>
<p>After taking a total of three bullet points in my notebook, the host of the second session I attended about hypergrowth was having trouble taking notes and listening to/facilitating the session. I volunteered to jump in to take the notes. Here's what I made:</p>
<p><span class="img_container" style="display: inline-block;"><img alt="" src="images/posts/2020/hypergrowth.png" style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Notes from hypergrowth session"><span class="img_caption" style="display: block; text-align: center;">Notes from hypergrowth session</span></span></p>
<p>I was trying to capture what people said, change the background colors, and move the notes around to put similar ideas next to each other. It was hard to know in the moment whether all of that is legible or helpful for anyone else. Luckily people in the session and in the Discord channel later thanked me for my work. I'm still struggling with how to impart any note-taking skill onto others, particularly when this can be seen as a gendered task.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Men: Wow, you are so good at taking notes!<br>
Me: You would be too if you got stuck being the one doing it all the time!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I digress, back to hypergrowth: The things that worked before COVID and at smaller orgs don't work at a bigger org today. Find your people within the smaller org - your department, your mentor, your friends - so you can feel stable even as things around you grow and change. Communicate your expectations clearly, for yourself and for your team. Keep a journal of what you've accomplished to feel more anchored in the value of your work. </p>
<p>After lunch, I started off in the wrong room because I didn't notice the sessions had been moved, but found my way to the one about coaching your peers. The conversation floated from a definition of terms to how to make space for mentoring. In order for people to mentor, there must be consent from the mentee. Ideally there is also some expertise in the organization around what is good, and someone (mentor or not) to teach the mentee what is good. The conversation reminded me of a talk I saw from Marianne Duijst; <a href="https://youtu.be/vXIZpe-x4o8?t=595">here's the moment she started talking about the difference between coaches, sponsors, teachers, and role models, and how they can support you in different ways</a>.</p>
<p>Anytime Maaret Pyhäjärvi is running an exploratory testing session, go to it. You will be better for it. This time, we tested a simple web application. We ended up spending most of the time adding scenarios to the automated tests Maaret had already set up in Robot framework. One of the questions it brought up for me: do you leave failed tests in your automation suite to highlight unexpected behavior? I had this problem this week: I'd updated a schema to validate against the current behavior while the story was in progress, instead of the behavior we wanted when it was done, so I could verify other fields in the output. Next time I think I'll separate them into two tests and leave them both as pending (marked as xfail in the pytest framework) so it's clear something needs to change before the software is released.</p>
<p>Thank you for the SoCraTes organizers for, as I learned a coach does, holding this space for us to examine ourselves and reflect. As someone who is much more fluent in emoji than GIF, I'm grateful to have won the hearts of the participants with this "letting the cat out of the bag" GIF in the GIF challenge.</p>

<p>In reviewing my notes from the TestBash Netherlands that occurred in May of 2019, two big, related themes jump out at me: </p>
<ol>
<li>keep exploratory testing</li>
<li>learn by sharing</li>
</ol>
<p>Andy Brown gave a talk about human factors in highly automated systems. As flying airplanes becomes more automated, pilots know less about how to switch to manual overrides in a time of crisis. You might not have more than a few hours a year of practice for when things go down. Continuing to share stories from the past and learn from them is one way out.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://twitter.com/Godtesen">Gitte Ottosen</a>, who gave us a tester's perspective on Agile, learning never ends. Understanding the customer journey and tying your work back to the business value are essential for making informed decisions about what to test, and which subset of those things to automate. Teaching, knowledge-sharing, coaching, and pairing can get the whole team involved in advancing quality, even if they're not all strong exploratory testers. </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JitGo">Jit Gosai</a> spoke about continuous testing. Practice test-driven development, story mapping, and three amigos meetings before the code is written. Improve automation test suites, use exploratory and mob testing, and incorporate feedback from the customer. When you're exploratory testing, you're not just confirming that the software functions as expected, you're testing the goal of your whole organization. Jit found that getting everybody on the team exploratory testing caught more bugs than automated tests. </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MaritvanDijk77">Marit van Dijk</a> hit the nail on the head with her talk: keep exploratory testing. Maintaining a consistent state of test data across mutliple teams is difficult. Rather than spend your time setting up control mechanisms for those systems, explore the systems themselves. Bugs are found not in the things we can control or know about, but in the space between systems. Pairing a developer with a tester was a lot faster than testing solo, because nobody had to go back and reproduce bugs. Spread the risk across systems by hooking them up one at a time.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/VeraGeBa">Vera Gehlen-Baum</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/isleoftesting">Beren Van Daele</a> spoke about incorporating your learning into your backlog. Identify what you want to learn, and write actionable acceptance criteria for your learning. This should include sharing what you've learned individually or with the team; it doesn't have to be confined to same sprint as the work for the team. Linking personal goals to business goals will ensure that people see they're improving.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/j19sch">Joep Schuurkes</a> talked us through what he was thinking as he was live-coding, which is learning and sharing at the most granular level. Separate concerns when you automate: keep what the code is supposed to accomplish separate from how it's accomplishing it. He expanded the CRUD heuristic that helps me decide what to automate, and added an extra DERR to make it CRUDDERR to ensure you can also debug, explore, run, and report on your code. </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Annosofie">Anne Colder</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/VinWijNL">Vincent Wijnen</a> gave an experience report about their mentor-mentee relationship. Mentoring is different from teaching. Ask questions about your mentee's experience, and expect different questions from them than you'd receive from your more experienced colleagues. Mentoring stimulates reflection on both sides. </p>
<p>Drew Pontikis spoke about the illusion of control. Challenge your own thinking by listening to new voices. Recognize when you can affect change in a situation.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/QualityFrog">Ben Simo</a> gave the last talk of the day about the art of scientific investigation. Design your next experiment based on your previous ones, and adapt as you go along. </p>
<p>There was a whole slew of 99-second talks, but the only memorable and explicable thing I wrote down from them was something Ilena said: "Understand your team doesn't function the way that you do." </p>
<p>The day prior to the day of talks, I helped facilitate and debrief a workshop that Joep Schuurkes developed around building an API testing framework. It was the first time we'd given it together, so that whole day was a 'learn by sharing' experience for me.</p>

<p>I found Humans Conf on Twitter, and found myself in a position to attend when <em>gestures at the general state of the world</em> moved it online. You can check out the output from the entire open space on the <a href="https://www.notion.so/June-2nd-2020-Virtual-Open-Space-26d1d0595b4b4574baf647025f3be544">Notion page</a>. It took place for a few hours on a Tuesday night. I discovered the energy it takes to listen and participate attentively in the evening affected my work for the following couple of days. I am only human!</p>
<p>The first session I attended was about making diversity more inclusive, and hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/buggylina">Lina Zubyte</a>. Due to the makeup of the participants, the conversation veered towards being a woman in tech. We spoke about incorrect assumptions, how we felt about particular language (especially <code>guys</code>), and how much energy that drains from us all the time. I heard stories from other women that echoed situations from my experience. I recognized how telling a story from a memorably bad day helps others understand and connect. I pondered if there's a way to make people understand, without reliving everyday indignities. My takeaway from the conversation was clear: you get to decide how to spend your energy. There will be people whose minds need changing, but the energy you would expend making that happen wouldn't be worth it. Let those people who challenge the premises of the problem space fall off your radar, and invest in people where you can make a difference. </p>
<p>For the second session, I started off in motivating interactions, hosted <a href="https://twitter.com/innoviva">Maren Baermann</a>. I truly enjoyed the model she introduced regarding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory#Motivations">extrinsic vs. intrinsic motivation</a>, and tying those to our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory#Basic_needs_and_intrinsic_motivation">basic needs</a>. But when the Zoom gods kicked me out of the free room, I took it as a sign to go search for a less interactive session where I could just listen. I landed in a session relating couples therapy to your team dynamics, hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/DariaDorda">Daria Dorda</a>. The conversation covered some national stereotypes, how people get distracted from the real message, and how to get the necessary distance to engage with a topic. My takeaway here was: if you don't set boundaries, others will for you. Amen.</p>
<p>I'm grateful to <a href="https://twitter.com/benjamin">Benjamin Reitzammer</a> who hosted the open space, and all the others who made it run smoothly. Seeing just a handful of familiar faces set me at ease. I'd never seen Zoom chat used effectively, but the rush of answers to the closing questions at the end of the evening gave me that warm &amp; fuzzy feeling like I'd actually attended a conference in person. I needed that, so thank you. </p>
<p>I don't think I can bring myself to join the next Humans Conf on Wednesday, 15 July. I've got a week off, and I need some time away from Zoom to be feeling more human. :)</p>

<p>I got a free ticket to Test Automation Day in 2018, just after I'd moved to Rotterdam. I was overwhelmed by the confluence of events: <a href="https://twitter.com/techgirl1908">Angie Jones</a> keynoting, <a href="https://twitter.com/ard_kramer">Ard Kramer</a> running the show, and meeting <a href="https://twitter.com/amyjph">Amy Phillips</a> in real life. (Neither of us were sure it was the first time we'd met because we'd been following each other on Twitter for so long!)</p>
<p>My most shocking note from Angie's keynote is "clicker, no notes," because of course Angie had her talk down pat. In a talk that anticipated the current, urgent conversation in AI and machine learning, Angie recognized that we can't agree on what human ethics should look like. Figure out who you're advocating for, and tie the bugs back to that business value. You're not going to be able to define all the business requirements up front; expect the unexpected.</p>
<p>Amy Phillips spoke about how tests in a DevOps environemnt allow you to get fast feedback. Like Agile, this style of working is not about minimizing the pain and struggle in developing software, but rather about bringing that pain forward. DevOps allows us to become aware of problems sooner, so we can act on them sooner. Running more tests is not necessarily better. Do not accept flaky tests. Free yourself from an overreliance on end-to-end tests and tests that cover non-critical paths to get your build time down. Rather than running tests on every commit, improve your monitoring. </p>
<p>I've got some quotes from other talks and the panel that day: </p>
<ul>
<li>"A tester is someone who believes things can be different." ~ Jerry Weinberg</li>
<li>"The team was not mature enough to determine priorities."</li>
<li>"Maintain the relationships you want to build."</li>
<li>"Are you just doing it because you can?" (regarding UI automation)</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't tell everybody how welcome and in the right place I felt by being able to jump in this day on short notice. </p>

<p>Imagine a scenario where you find a software bug. You go to another colleague. They perform the exact same reproduction steps you did. But the bug doesn't happen on their machine. What now? </p>
<h4>Works on my machine</h4>
<p>Your colleague may not believe you found a bug, or they may not be sure if you did. They may blame you for doing something you shouldn't have. They may insist that most users have a machine more like theirs than yours, and it doesn't matter if it doesn't work on your machine. They may think it's too much trouble to track down what's happening on your machine, and leave the burden to you to figure it out. They could have a fixed mindset, and think that you, your machine, the software you're running never change. (<a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">Read more about fixed vs. growth mindsets in this brilliant Brain Pickings article.</a>)</p>
<h4>Does not work on every machine</h4>
<p>Instead, they could have started with belief. They could commend you for uncovering something they themselves could not. They could be curious about how your machine and software are different from what they have running, and look into how many other users this is affecting. They could pair with you to come up with ideas about how to stop the issue from happening. If they have more access to the underlying systems, they could look into the code and configuration settings. They could have a growth mindset, and think that your machine, the software you're running, and most of all you, can change. </p>
<h4>Start with belief</h4>
<p>Now, imagine a different scenario. Imagine someone describes being mistreated by the police. They were doing something that is fully within their rights, and the cops said they weren't allowed to. </p>
<blockquote>I believe you.</blockquote>

<p>Start with belief. Do not think that because you've had different interactions with the police, that the police must not treat people in the way you're hearing. Do not think that your individual circumstances, particularly the color of your skin, means that you'll be fine. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0971Hy5eo">Think more about how racism is fascism applied to a particular category.</a>) Take the time to shut up, listen, and discover how you can help. Believe that things can change. It starts with belief.</p>
