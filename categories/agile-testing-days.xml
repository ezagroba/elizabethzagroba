It was such a privilege and an honor to meet so many of the people I'd only know from the internet. Reading through my notes now, much of what I wrote down has become engrained into how I go about my work everyday. What a blessing it was to encounter the people I needed to learn from in my career at the time I needed to learn from them. I'm glad to see how routine their wisdom has become for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lisihocke"&gt;Lisi Hocke&lt;/a&gt; gave a talk about growth. I've since seen more of her talks and prepared a workshop with her; I see how she embodies this in her approach to the world. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NativeWired"&gt;Gitte Klitgaard&lt;/a&gt; reminded me that believing in people will allow them to be better. Stay curious about why people are doing what they do before placing judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Punkmik"&gt;Kim Knup&lt;/a&gt; spoke about a zero bug policy (not any bugs in your backlog). I was not ready to hear this message at the time, having come from places with years-old products and tens or hundreds of bugs in the backlog. But now I see exactly what she was describing: the psychological relief that comes from less time in JIRA and fewer meetings about priorities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/katrinaclokie"&gt;Katrina Clokie&lt;/a&gt; pulled up Noah Sussman's reimagining of the testing pyrmaid (lots of small tests, fewer large ones) upside-down as a bug filter. And suddenly, it clicked for me. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex_schl"&gt;Alex Schladebeck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/huibschoots"&gt;Huib Schoots&lt;/a&gt; challenged me to think on a meta-level about the testing I was doing, to name the skills and techniques I was using. It would help me as I spent the following years sharing exploratory testing skills with other testers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ewebber"&gt;Emily Webber&lt;/a&gt; spoke about building trust on teams. I find myself recommending the &lt;a href="https://emilywebber.co.uk/the-team-manual-a-exercise-to-help-build-empathy-in-teams/"&gt;team manual&lt;/a&gt; she developed to somebody about once a month, plus she helped spark an idea for a future conference talk I developed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lunivore"&gt;Liz Keogh&lt;/a&gt; gave me the words I needed to build a safe-to-fail environment for my team members, where failure is an expected, inevitable part of complex systems. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized in compiling this blog post that I'd already written about Agile Testing Days just one month after I'd attended in 2017. At that point, I was looking specifically at regression testing advice, which is what I was in the thick of at work. What am I in the thick of now, and when will it become clear to me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>agile-testing-days</category><category>conference</category><category>testing</category><guid>https://elizabethzagroba.com/posts/2021/agile_testing_days_2017/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 10 Apr 2021 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Agile Testing Days 2020</title><link>https://elizabethzagroba.com/posts/2020/2020-11-29_agile_testing_days_2020/</link><dc:creator>Elizabeth Zagroba</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you say no to what you don't have the energy for, you leave your time, attention, and devotion free to pursue what keeps you energized. Through a tumult of plans and dreams that only 2020 could continue to crush, the Agile Testing Days crew put on a revitalizing conference. I only caught a glimpse of the preparation that went into providing a top-notch experience for speakers and participants, and I have to commend the group on their commitment to the cause. Bravo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks were recorded. I've decided to cut myself off on catching up on missed talks after two weeks. Reflecting on what wisdom I've garned from a small subset of the offerings at Agile Testing Days will be more valuable than being exposed to every last word. In that spirit, let me give you a few takeaways in place of an exhaustive recap or analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parveen Khan: watch this if you're looking to collaborate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is in doing the work that we discover what we must do. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't get stuck when learning something alone; pair. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;João Proença: watch this if you need a different direction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performing a health check and making a diagnosis are different skills. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What barriers do we set for ourselves?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The product is all the pieces the customers see, including the cloud infrastructure (and whatever else your team isn't responsible for). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Holland &amp;amp; Huib Schoots: watch this if your automation isn't providing valuable information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sunk cost fallacy means we're unlikely to get rid of automation code, even if it's ineffective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We often fail at getting people to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gitte Kligaard talk: watch this if you've been hiding your true self at work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"I'm just going to rewind." (Possibly my favorite takeaway from this conference, I'm going to use this anytime I trip over my words.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creativity comes when inspired by others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being professional is knowing your craft, and admitting when you don't know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend time with yourself to listen to yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex Schladebeck &amp;amp; Ashley Hunsberger: no recording, but follow these ladies on Twitter for how to balance life and leadership&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell people what you want. They may be able to help you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a clear vision of what you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write down your fear. Ask yourself: Why is this positive? How can I build the courage to do this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be explicit about what you're doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show how you're working.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a practice of reflection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angie Jones: watch this if you need a push to get into automation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine your goal first. If you don't know it, you'll definitely fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you're a leader, celebrate the small victories. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's no reason to shame people for being creative and doing the best they can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's not realistic to assume master level by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find out why developers don't participate in automation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob Meaney: watch this if you don't get why observability is important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We learn profound lessons from painful experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build relationships. Influence people at the right time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pain + reflection =&amp;gt; progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn't matter how much we test a thing if nobody wants to use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tobias Geyer: watch this if you're struggling with an ethical dilemna &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could ethics be a non-functional requirement?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the codes of ethics proposed by the IEEE, ISTQB, ACM, and James Bach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hippocrattic oath for software testing: avoid harm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promote environment sustainability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smita Mishra: watch this if you're interviewing users &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen to be able to ask clarifying questions and dig deeper. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask users: their objective, what they found, about the impact, where they're struggling, what could make their lives easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eveline Moolenaars: watch this if you're learning to coach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"We have a policy; it's somewhere on the internet" isn't enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Everyone deserves a coach to make them aware of what they've forgotten." ~Brad Gilbert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federico Toledo: watch this if you or those around you are losing steam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tester with a sense of purpose is more resilient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on strengths more than weaknesses, turning up the good. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide visibility that you're doing something with the feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask people if they're getting what they need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicola Sedgwick: watch this if you're the gatekeeper for quality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not correlate your own successes with the quality of the entire system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contract-driven work is not holistic quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Report when there has been no progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for a code walk-through before a build is ready.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shift quality left all the way to the executive team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testers were hoarding responsibility for quality. Let it go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joep Schuurkes: watch this if (or while) you're stuck in an ineffective meeting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself: is my work inside or outside of meetings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the right group of people in the room before holding a meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Express specific appreciations for things done well so people will keep doing them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meetings are synchornous collaboration with a purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standups should remove impediments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The metaphors we choose say something about how we feel about our work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leadership is creating an environment where everyone can contribute to solving a problem. ~Jerry Weinberg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clare Norman: watch this if you're truly stuck&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quality is everyone's care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Success is liking who you are, what you do, and how you do it." ~Maya Angelou&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your courage quota for the day might vary. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don't get better by doing the same thing everyday. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn't know how I needed to be helped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can't drag someone through time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We live far less in the present than we ought to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How magical is it when people value the change that you're making?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passion spreads when other people share in your excitement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a cheerleader in your life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="img_container" style="display: inline-block;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://elizabethzagroba.com/images/posts/2020/success.png" style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Clare Norman channeling Maya Angelou on success"&gt;&lt;span class="img_caption" style="display: block; text-align: center;"&gt;Clare Norman channeling Maya Angelou on success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenny Bramble: watch this if your tests are failing on expected behavior&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many defects I filed are never fixed. Unfixed defects become expected behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automation has never found a defect. Automation tells us behavior has changed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tests should pass on expected behavior, including some defects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document your tests for others, including your future self.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Lyndsay &amp;amp; Anne Colder: watch this if you feel like an impostor &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acknowledge when you can't help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you could take one step forward, what would you do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to your person, or ask a smaller group of people if they have an answer to your problem. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forgiveness is one of the most powerful things you can do as a human being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After you make a mistake: wallow in it (really feel it first), forgive yourself, then dance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your job title allows other people to figure out how to work with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gitte Klitgaard AMA: watch this if you miss the hallway track&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen to hear what's being said, not to respond. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can't read minds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a safe space allows you to feel uncomfortable. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silence is a tool. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sophie Küster: watch this if you're ready to tell your colleagues your big secret&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is strength in showing vulnerability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People want to help you. Let them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself: how am I treating myself?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly. Poorly done is better than not done at all. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gitte Klitgaard &amp;amp; Morgan Ahlström: watch this if you want to get psychological safety in the boardroom and on the roadmap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make time to address psychological safety. Put it on the same level in your team's goals as your product goals. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are role models. We lead by example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More people were uncomfortable giving than receiving code reviews. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ard Kramer: watch this if you're getting burned out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humans have an unrealitic belief in our own influence. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performing your testing role doesn't make you popular. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most people looking for confirmation that the software is working. To form a logical proof, we look for evidence that the software doesn't work. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself: which circumstances could I control? Did I manage expectations correctly? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm grateful I got to connect with people who keep me going. I'm grateful Agile Testing Days tried to make this work in person. I'm grateful I was able to drop my workshop instead of abaondoning people in breakout rooms to do something they've never done before. I'm grateful the mobbing session I helped organize and facilitate went smoothly. I'm grateful that my job allows me the time and space to be rejunivated by this all. I'm grateful. 🙏&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>agile-testing-days</category><category>conference</category><category>testing</category><guid>https://elizabethzagroba.com/posts/2020/2020-11-29_agile_testing_days_2020/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 28 Nov 2020 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
