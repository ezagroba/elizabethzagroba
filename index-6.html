    <p>I moved into a different role at work this week. I handed off my former team to the new team lead with a final 1-on-1 (and coincidentally performance review) for each team member. Each of them has a different variety of skills, motivators driving them, and awareness of either. This blog post focuses on just one team member. </p>
<h3>"I did it!"</h3>
<p>One team member is really driven by that "I did it!" feeling. They're early in their career. Both the product and the company are new to them. They spend a lot of their time pairing, asking for help, or floudering while wondering if they should be pairing or asking for help. Every 1-on-1, they'd report feeling that they hadn't learned or accomplished anything. They weren't getting that "I did it!" feeling.</p>
<p>But they were doing a great job. They were making progress in all the different technologies our team uses (Mendix, Docker, OpenAPI, pytest, gitlab pipelines, etc.), learning as they went. They were able to accept feedback to course-correct when necessary. They knew they were learning a lot, but this alone wasn't motivating enough for them.</p>
<h3>Forces within our control</h3>
<p>As a team lead, part of my job was to create focus for my team. There was a cloud of possibilities and priorities the people around and above us struggled to make clear. I wanted to create an environment where my team members could still get that "I did it!" feeling anyway. This Liz and Mollie comic captures it nicely. </p>
<p><span class="img_container" style="display: inline-block;"><img alt="A great manager holds umbrella to protect team from ridiculous requests, unclear priorities, massive uncertainty, unneccessary meetings, last-minute chaos; and foster clear expectations, defined roles, work-life balance, stable achieveable goals" src="images/posts/2021/liz-and-mollie-umbrella.jpg" style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="@lizandmollie"><span class="img_caption" style="display: block; text-align: center;">@lizandmollie</span></span></p>
<p>Amid this uncertainty, my team member requested  clear steps for what they should be doing next and how to get promoted. I started by sending them the job description they hadn't seen for his own job. This helped set clear expectations and define their role. I spent time in our 1-on-1's finding out more about what was on their mind or dragging their attention away from work. </p>
<p>I took the time to reinforce the importance of a work-life balance. We started every refinement meeting with a review of upcoming time off, complete with peer pressure from me to take more of it. This allowed us to only refine the amount of work we could accomplish in the upcoming period, and set expectations for what wouldn't be done. This helped scope and clarify each team member's job. </p>
<p>I tried to give all my team members the "I did it!" feeling by talking about what we accomplished at the smallest scale in standup, a slightly larger scale in retro, and on the largest scale in the meeting with the whole unit. But that wasn't helping this particular team member. </p>
<p>The thing that finally gave them that "I did it!" feeling was: a Trello board for their own personal career development, with To Do, Doing, and Done columns. </p>
<h4>To Do</h4>
<p>We identified a clear, actionable step to take for a few technologies, job description bullet points, and conversations we'd already been having in our 1-on-1's. Some items would be accomplished during the course of our regular work on user stories. I set a clear expectation about the other items: they were for work time - downtime while waiting for a response, crafting days, etc. They were not for personal time.</p>
<h4>Doing</h4>
<p>I explained that it's better to limit the number of items in this column at a time. Deciding what to leave aside allows you to focus on what's in front of you. My team member want to be an expert in all our of different technologies at once. I reset this expectation: get a little better, one at a time.</p>
<h3>Done</h3>
<p>I gave them homework to fill in the Done column. They took time to list things they had learned and accomplished in the previous months. Scrolling through the Done list got them pretty close to that "I did it!" feeling. Taking a moment to reflect during our 1-on-1's helped give them that feeling. But they weren't getting that feeling right away. They needed to celebrate their accomplishments as they were happening, to keep up the motivation and momentum. </p>
<p>I did what was possibly my best management move for this person: I threw confetti.</p>
<p>Trello has a feature where if you add the confetti ball emoji to the title of a column, moving an item to that column throws a little confetti around the item. It's very cute, and it finally gave my team member that "I did it!" feeling. </p>
<h3>Setting expectations around the feeling</h3>
<p>In the handoff to the new team lead, I explained this need my team member had, the ways I'd tried to meet it, and the confetti ball that finally worked. I pointed out that the need for the "I did it!" feeling can be found in other ways. The important thing for the team lead is not a particular action, but checking in with the team member about the feeling. I wanted to leave them space to take a different approach, so I used the "Mary had a little lamb" heuristic to explain what a different approach should include. </p>
<h4>
<em>I</em> did it!</h4>
<p>The team member wanted to point to something they did. Without pairing, without asking a bunch of questions, they wanted to point to something and know that they were able to accomplish it themselves. </p>
<h4>I <em>did</em> it!</h4>
<p>The thing had to be done. While some skills and knowledge transfer could be months or years in the making, they needed something to come to a close. </p>
<h4>I did <em>it</em>!</h4>
<p>The new team lead and the team member get to decide together what's on the list, what it is. Growth and comfort in skills may not be immediately visible to the invidual in the day-to-day grind. Setting aside time for individual reflection or recognition at the 1-on-1 would help. </p>
<h4>I did it <em>!</em>
</h4>
<p>This is the confetti ball piece of the puzzle. The celebration. It may feel silly, or gimicky, but it finally got this person that satisfaction they were looking for out of their job. </p>
<hr>
<h3>Reflection</h3>
<ul>
<li>When managing, do you dig into what a person needs to have clear expectations, defined roles, work-life balance, and stable achieveable goals?</li>
<li>When a team member asks you for an outcome, do you think about why they're asking you for that? </li>
<li>When you do handoffs, do you describe the actions you took or the needs they were serving? </li>
</ul>

    <p>A colleague came to me with a request the other day. I didn't handle it quite how I wanted to. The request went something like this:</p>
<p>"I remember you were on the team for Big Scary product a couple years ago. Do you know if I can delete this List of Stuff from Big Scary product, and if I can automate that?"</p>
<p>I did not know. It was two years ago. Big Scary product had gotten Bigger and Scarier in the meantime. </p>
<p>But I knew where my team linked to our API specs from our customer-facing documentation. I applied the same principle to discover where Big Scary product API specs were. I looked at those specs and found the List of Stuff in a response body for an API call, but noticed that my colleague wouldn't have the ID the request required. So I looked at the API specs from a Bigger Scarier product. Combining a call from there would get the ID Big Scary product needed.</p>
<p>I was short on time, so I answered the question directly. I said it was possible, and possible to automate, and provided the links to the specs for both products. My colleague thanked me, and left the conversation able to solve their problem quickly. </p>
<p>I gave them the fish. What they learned from that interaction was: Elizabeth knows where to find stuff. I can come to her when I don't know how to find stuff and she will find it for me. That was the wrong lesson. </p>
<h3>Give Them the Fish, Then Teach Them to Fish</h3>
<p>A better lesson would have been: I know where to look for things. Elizabeth will give me the tools to know where to look, and empower me to do so. Now that I've got the access and seen it done once before, I can take a few more steps before I reach out Elizabeth the next time.</p>
<p>Here's what I could have done to get to get this colleague there:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explain where all the API specs live: I could have explained my thought process for finding the API specs, showed how I navigate using the headers and <code>Ctrl + F</code> on the page, and compare the requests and responses to what's needed.</li>
<li>Update them about who's on the team for Big Scary product now: I could have listed a few team members names who I knew were working on Big Scary product, or pointed my colleague to the Slack channel for the whole team.</li>
<li>Introduce colleague to a member of the team for Big Scary product: Since this colleague was a tester, I could have started a direct message with them and the tester on the team for Big Scary product, copying the question from the DM I first received. </li>
</ol>
<h3>What If I Only Teach Them to Fish?</h3>
<p>What would have happened if I'd skipped what I'd done, and withheld the links to the API specs? </p>
<p>I wouldn't have been able to guarantee that my colleague was in the learning zone. From what I knew about their situation, they were accumulating a lot of data that they wanted to delete. I didn't know what other pressures were coming from the team, but the need to automate it suggested it was a bigger problem than just a few extra entries in a database. </p>
<p>Giving my colleague the fish, and <em>then</em> teaching them to fish, relieves any of that pressure to deliver, and helps open them up to learning and growing. </p>
<h3>Tell Them What You're Doing</h3>
<p>Some colleagues are distracted, or dense, or not able to take away <a href="https://elizabethzagroba.com/posts/2021/delivering_information_vs_delivering_meta_information/">meta-information</a> from a conversation along with the information. They may stop listening after they have the answer. </p>
<p>Combat this by sharing your motives. Remind them that you too are busy. Explain that your goal is to empower them. Encourage them to reach out to the team working on Big Scary product, so that those team members can also get good at knowing where to look and answering colleagues' questions. Tell them you're happy to help them again, but you'll expect more details of what they tried first. Then hold them to that. </p>
<p>The best lesson is: I want to take a few more steps next time I have a problem, because I know I can, and Elizabeth expects more from me. </p>

    <p>I had a long drought between when I was last able to just attend a conference (rather than running a session or organizing) and SoCraTes UK in June. A year I think? And what a welcome rain it was. </p>
<hr>
<p>Heloá hosted a session on meditation. I recognized many of the symptoms she described as her motivators for picking up the habit from <a href="https://elizabethzagroba.com/assets/slides/introvert.pdf">a talk I did about introversion years ago</a>. And the mindset she described (trying over succeeding, recognizing reactions without trying to impose a particular one) echoed back to a conversation on stoicism that <a href="https://twitter.com/SimplySanne">Sanne Visser</a> hosted at the first TestCraftCamp. I was completely convinced by the benefits she described ("People say I sound calmer. I'm breathing more deeply.") but I haven't built a habit around it yet. C'est la vie. </p>
<p>I went to two different sessions <a href="https://twitter.com/maaretp">Maaret Pyhäjärvi</a> hosted. (Does this make me a groupie?) The first, an ensemble testing session, reminded me that the most valuable exploratory testing bugs come when you understand enough about the business and the architecture to know what matters to some person who matters. The second session was about scaling workshops (and really, herself). I joined late after the lightning talks ended, but still helped plant the seed of what I and SoCraTes can do to bring more people into learning about good software. </p>
<p>I selfishly hosted a "help me out here" session in the afternoon. As I predicted, the testers extraordinaire Maaret and <a href="https://twitter.com/lisihocke">Lisi Hocke</a> were exactly the people I needed to give me perspective on my current and evolving role at work, though the other attendees contributed as well. I came away with more questions than answers, which I'm still mulling over and digging into weeks later. I look forward to sharing more about the shape of things as they come to fruition.</p>
<p>Alexander (What is your last name?? Sorry!) held a session on habits you've developed or changed during the pandemic. How lovely it was to be in a small conversation trading notes about remote music lesssons and holding remote workshops. It was exactly the kind of hallway conversation I'd be looking to fall into at a flesh-and-blood conference.</p>
<p>I didn't write down who gave the lightning talk about saying no, but thank you. I rarely (never?) regret saying no, but I needed that extra push and specific language to have those "If you want me to pick this up, which of these things should I be putting down then?" conversations I've had lately. I have "Saying no commands respect" in my notes, and I guess I need a throw pillow of that too. </p>
<hr>
<p>SoCraTes reinforces for me how a welcoming, inclusive open space is done. It's through <a href="https://twitter.com/AmelieCornelis/status/1393945719413825542">explaining what an open space is for people who haven't attended</a>. It's who's on the organizing committee. It's reminding people to take time off from the sessions. It's about ending up in the "Rose Garden" at the same time as <a href="https://twitter.com/EvaNanyonga">Eva Nanyonga</a>, who's working to improve the dispatching of home helathcare workers in Uganda, and finding out you sparked her curiosity and delight in the exploratory testing session earlier in the day. It's about providing a subsidized ticket option to make the event accessible to more people. It's in offering advice to the hosts at the start, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>ask for help facilitating</li>
<li>kick off the discussion</li>
<li>include everyone in the conversation</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for holding this space. It's got me excited to host the open space that TestCraftCamp has evolved into, Friends of Good Software (<a href="https://frogsconf.nl/">FroGS Conf</a>) in September. </p>

    <p>Recently, I made an outline for a tester (who was still onboarding) for what kinds of things to test on a new API endpoint we added. They explored, wrote a bunch of automated tests to capture their work, and came back with a list of interesting and good catches in the error responses. My first question in our debrief was: did you try a successful response? They hadn't. I sent them back to tackle that too. </p>
<p>Because a successful response is the first thing our product owner is going to ask about. That's what we'd want to show off at the review meeting internally to demonstrate the new API endpoint. That's the first the customer is going to try. They're going to copy the request from our OpenAPI specification, paste it in Postman (or the tool of their choice, but our customers so far have been using Postman), and see if their credentials will get them the response that matches the specification. These stakeholders share a common concern, and that's the risk we should be migitating with testing. First. </p>
<h3>Complete the main quest first.</h3>
<p>Complete the main quest first. Come back to the side quests. </p>
<p>A customer had asked for this API endpoint to be added. If we'd tested the happy path first, we would have had the option of releasing the API for the customer to use. The risk of discovering a successful request wouldn't yield a successful response was relatively low in this case, since our developers tend to try one happy path themselves.</p>
<p>But what if the main quest had required a lot of setup, explanations to build knowledge and context for the onboarding tester, or yielded an issue? I'd done a risk-based analysis of what all to complete as part of our definition of done for this story. But I hadn't shared my approach to completing the main quest first, so the tester did what testers do, and went on a hunt to find weird stuff. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/posts/2021/iceland.jpg"></p>
<h3>Note down and follow-up on werid stuff; do not get distracted by it</h3>
<p>Software will break in all sorts of ways. The more time and curiosity you have to dig into it, the more you'll discover. But are those the most important things? </p>
<p>In this API, the tester discovered that if you paste 10,000 characters into a field that's meant for a UUID, you get a 400 response. But did they try a regular old UUID first? What if they get a 400 response no matter what they put in that field, because the field name in the specification doesn't match what's in the code? Is trying 10,000 characters the first and biggest risk they have to face when presenting this API to a customer?</p>
<p>I'm not saying don't try 10,000 characters. <a href="https://twitter.com/ezagroba/status/1234822805709053953">I love that shit</a>. But decide if it's a risk you care about first. <a href="https://elizabethzagroba.com/posts/2020/2020-05-24_if_a_test_falls_in_a_forest/">If you don't care about the outcome, don't test it</a>. Don't make busy-work for yourself just to fill the time. </p>
<h3>Make side quests a concious choice</h3>
<p>Before you start throwing 10,000 characters at your API, talk to your team. Your developer can probably tell you if they never built something to deal with that situation. Your product owner can tell you they'd rather have it to the customer sooner. Your data analyst can tell you if there's already longer stuff than that in the database, or if you should be trying Japanese instead. </p>
<p>Make side quests a deliberate choice. Share them to increase their value or figure out who on the team is best-suited to execute them. </p>
<h3>Recognize when the quest is a journey, not a destination</h3>
<p>Throwing 10,000 characters at an API may be a way to start a discussion about the speed at which responses are returned. It might be a way of showing <a href="http://coffeeipsum.com/">your favorite random text generator</a> to your fellow tester. It might be an exercise at an ensemble testing session, where everyone can practice pausing before executing an idea to describe the expected behavior first. </p>
<p>Quests can be valuable in ways that are not directly related to the finishing the quest. </p>
<p><em>Note: I got asked recently if I use the word charter much with non-testers. I don't. Try reading this again but replacing every mention of "quest" with "charter".</em></p>
