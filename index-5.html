<p>After years of getting rejected, the talk I submitted to Agile Testing Days in 2017 finally got me accepted. It was such a privilege and an honor to meet so many of the people I'd only know from the internet. Reading through my notes now, much of what I wrote down has become engrained into how I go about my work everyday. What a blessing it was to encounter the people I needed to learn from in my career at the time I needed to learn from them. I'm glad to see how routine their wisdom has become for me.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://twitter.com/lisihocke">Lisi Hocke</a> gave a talk about growth. I've since seen more of her talks and prepared a workshop with her; I see how she embodies this in her approach to the world. </li>
<li>
<a href="https://twitter.com/NativeWired">Gitte Klitgaard</a> reminded me that believing in people will allow them to be better. Stay curious about why people are doing what they do before placing judgment.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://twitter.com/Punkmik">Kim Knup</a> spoke about a zero bug policy (not any bugs in your backlog). I was not ready to hear this message at the time, having come from places with years-old products and tens or hundreds of bugs in the backlog. But now I see exactly what she was describing: the psychological relief that comes from less time in JIRA and fewer meetings about priorities.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://twitter.com/katrinaclokie">Katrina Clokie</a> pulled up Noah Sussman's reimagining of the testing pyrmaid (lots of small tests, fewer large ones) upside-down as a bug filter. And suddenly, it clicked for me. </li>
<li>
<a href="https://twitter.com/alex_schl">Alex Schladebeck</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/huibschoots">Huib Schoots</a> challenged me to think on a meta-level about the testing I was doing, to name the skills and techniques I was using. It would help me as I spent the following years sharing exploratory testing skills with other testers.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://twitter.com/ewebber">Emily Webber</a> spoke about building trust on teams. I find myself recommending the <a href="https://emilywebber.co.uk/the-team-manual-a-exercise-to-help-build-empathy-in-teams/">team manual</a> she developed to somebody about once a month, plus she helped spark an idea for a future conference talk I developed.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://twitter.com/lunivore">Liz Keogh</a> gave me the words I needed to build a safe-to-fail environment for my team members, where failure is an expected, inevitable part of complex systems. </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>I realized in compiling this blog post that I'd already written about Agile Testing Days just one month after I'd attended in 2017. At that point, I was looking specifically at regression testing advice, which is what I was in the thick of at work. What am I in the thick of now, and when will it become clear to me?</p>

<p>I was on <a href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/discussion-critical-thinking">a panel about critical thinking for the Ministry of Testing</a> last week. One of my fellow panelists and commendable ranter <a href="https://twitter.com/Maaikees">Maaike Brinkoff</a> brought up <em>ad hominem</em> (personal) attacks as one example of a failure of critical thinking. It's one of many <a href="https://fallacyinlogic.com/">logical fallacies</a> that are worth exploring further. </p>
<p>Equipping yourself with the name for a thing helps you recognize it when it appears. (Lara Hogan wrote recently about applying the skill, of <a href="https://leaddev.com/communication-relationships/skill-naming-whats-happening-room">being able to name the problem in the room</a>, to defuse tense meetings.) These are some of the fallacies I've across recently when I've been debriefing testing sessions, facilitating refinement sessions, and reviewing conference submissions.</p>
<h4>Affirming the consequent</h4>
<p>Affirming the consequent is applying a conditional without the conditionality, or assuming something happened because you see a result. </p>
<ol>
<li>If P (I run the pipeline) then Q (the latest build will be available on the test environment)</li>
<li>Q (the latest build is available on the test environment)</li>
<li>Therefore P (I ran the pipeline) </li>
</ol>
<p>We can't assume the converse: if Q, then P. Just because the latest build is on the test environment doesn't mean I ran the pipeline. Maybe someone else ran the pipeline, or put the build there manually. Maybe there haven't been any changes since yesterday, and the build from yesterday is still the latest one.</p>
<h4>Fallacy of composition</h4>
<p>This assumes that something that applies to one member of a class applies to them all.</p>
<ol>
<li>Y is part of X (Stephanie is an admin user)</li>
<li>Y has property P (Stephanie can see this page)</li>
<li>X has property P (any admin user can see this page)</li>
</ol>
<p>We can't assume that what's true for one member of a class applies to all of them. What happens if Stephanie can be assigned more than one role, a more restrictive/regular user role in addition to the admin role? Can she still see it? What if Stephanie being able to see the page has nothing to do with her status as an admin user?</p>
<h4>
<em>Post hoc ergo propter hoc</em> (correlation without causation)</h4>
<p>This one is easiest to see when others are debreifing their testing to me, but I've also learned to catch for myself. </p>
<ol>
<li>Event A occurred (I clicked the button)</li>
<li>Then event B occurred (a whole bunch of log messages appeared)</li>
<li>Therefore A caused B (clicking the button caused a whole bunch of log messages)</li>
</ol>
<p>We can't assume that events that occur in a particular sequence in time are necessarily causal. Did clicking the button trigger the log messages? What do the log messages say? Did you read them? Who else could be using this environment? Does the same thing happen every time you click the button, or when you run the application in a different environment? </p>
<h4>Argument from repetition</h4>
<p>When someone says the same thing enough times, or brings up the same unimportant issue in a refinement meeting week after week, it can become easier to address the issue rather than convincing them yet again why it's not a priority. I've been facilitating refinement meetings every week for my teams for the past two years. <a href="https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/">I only have a finite amount of energy</a> that is not always worth expending by refuting the case for a small edge case week after week. </p>
<hr>
<p>Shoutout to my logic professor Dan Cohen at Colby College, who had us memorize and distinguish logical fallacies as part of his brilliant Logic and Argumentation course, and pointing out that an ease and comfort with truth tables would translate well to a computer science course. Special thanks to Joep Schuurkes for his philosophical and technological opinions on this piece.</p>

<p><a href="https://testcraftcamp.nl/">TestCraftCamp</a>, the unconference I co-organize, had its third installment yesterday. I'm glad I had enough energy to attend more sessions this time, though of course the "too many good things happen at once" problem remained, as it does with any valuable conference. I was able to join a discussion <a href="https://twitter.com/maaretp">Maaret Pyhäjärvi</a> (who is so often a driving force behind gatherings like these) about low and high value work, a discussion Joep Schuurkes led on daily writing practices, part of a session <a href="https://twitter.com/witchofthetest">Veerle Verhagen</a> hosted on testing without touching (before I realized I'd spent too long looking at the product under test already), as well as finding some of my brethren in between the sessions. </p>
<hr>
<p>I took notes in a sprawling mind map for another session Veerle hosted, which she pitched as "spicing up your long-term relationship! (with your project)." Besides the memorable pitch, I was excited to see this topic on the schedule for a couple reasons:</p>
<p>First, I've been working on my current product for two years. Some new people have joined the project recently, and having to explain and document the intricacies of our product keeps giving me new reasons to question the decisions we've made as the product has been developed. </p>
<p>Second, I don't think this it's something we typically acknowledge: our skills can get stale and our motivation can wane when we've developed a certain level of comfort and mastery with a particular team and product. Even without changing jobs or teams, it can be worthwhile to shake things up. </p>
<p>On my project, adding permanent designers and engineers to the team is shaking things up. The hive mind in the session came up with many other ways to get new people involved in testing, if temporarily: </p>
<ul>
<li>hold a bug hunt or an <a href="https://www.lisihocke.com/2021/02/ensemble-is-the-new-mob.html">ensemble</a>
</li>
<li>teach an intern</li>
<li>swap products with another tester</li>
<li>bring your product to a meetup</li>
<li>pay for <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/product/bounty">crowdsourced testing</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I collected a sprawling list of people's ideas for how you as an individual can gain perspective and change the way you're looking at your work. Taking notes on a multi-faceted conversation is hard, and in reviewing them, I realize they fall better into these groups: </p>
<ul>
<li>identify the assumptions you've built over time (which aren't true? which can be discarded? what's hard to talk about? how can I change perspective?)</li>
<li>think about risks (<a href="https://testobsessed.com/2006/12/the-nightmare-headline-game-planning-for-the-unexpected/">nightmare headlines</a>, investigate competitors, talk to users, <a href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com/testsphere/riskstorming">riskstorming</a>)</li>
<li>use different testing personas (extreme conditions, <a href="https://www.logigear.com/logi_media_dir/Documents/whitepapers/soap_opera_testing.pdf">soap operas</a>, <a href="https://www.stickyminds.com/article/10-exploratory-testing-tours-you-can-use-analyze-artifacts">testing tours</a>, dogfooding/drinking your own champagne, <a href="https://theuserisdrunk.com/">this</a>)</li>
<li>step back (take a break, go on vacation, switch projects)</li>
</ul>
<p>As a counterpoint, the group in the session did acknowledge that reaching a point of comfort and mastery can be a good thing. (See chapter 4 of <a href="https://leanpub.com/becomingatechnicalleader">Jerry Weinberg's Becoming a Technical Leader</a> for more on plateaus and ravines.) After months or years on a project, you'll know where to look first for what your developers typically miss. You'll know what's not worth testing. In Veerle's case, the application has been getting 5-star reviews, which provides one positive angle on product quality. </p>
<hr>
<p>Thanks so much to the facilitators, participants, and other organizers of TestCraftCamp. It's so fulfilling to get to the end of a long day and hear that we created a "safe environment," people who were only planning to stay for the morning lasted all day, and people were able to take breaks when they needed to. I'm glad we were able to fill others back up with energy. </p>

<p>In 2015 when TestBash came to the United States for the first time, it was to New York. I was living in the city, but I was stuck at a job that wouldn't pay for a ticket. "Ask Rosie if you can volunteer," my mentor/sponsor/benefactor Martin Hynie suggested. Rosie, who I knew only as the lady who'd mailed me Ministry of Testing stickers from England for...no reason at all, obviously let me in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People ask "can we do it?" instead of asking "should we do it?"</p>
<p>~<cite>Keith Klain</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got to crash the speakers dinner. I got to go to Selena Delesie's workshop about leadership and change. At the end of the day, she praised my active participation and thanked me for being in her workshop. I was already confident in my testing skills, but she helped me see myself as a potential leader. In a follow-up coaching session I had with Selena about negotiating a higher salary, she asked me why I wanted more money. I'd recently moved into an apartment by myself, and couldn't think of what I would do with more money. It's something I think about with every job change, every growth in title and responsibility. Realizing I didn't want or need more money was a crucial step on the path to life-changing relocation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The common denominator in all your dysfunctional relationships is you.</p>
<p>~<cite>Keith Klain</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>During a break between talks the following day, I snuck on stage wearing "the" Ministry of Testing tutu. During another, I wrote a bunch of notes to give a 99-second talk about leaving a closing comment on a story (which I completely forgot about, <a href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/defining-story-completion-as-a-software-tester">before later writing on this topic for the Dojo</a>). While waiting on stage behind dozens of people waiting to give their 99-second talks, I improvised one about moonwalking instead.</p>

<p>I met Helena Jeret-Mäe, Maaret Pyhäjärvi, Dan Ashby, who along with the conference friendships I was just beginning to foster, gave me a vision of what my career could be, and where it could go at a time when I knew I needed something different. Helena saw my talk at Let's Test the following spring, and gave me valuable critical feedback that helped shaped future talks. Maaret introduced me to strong-style pairing, which changed the way I worked with my colleagues to this day. Dan had me on his podcast, reinforcing for me the success of my talk at the following year's TestBash USA. </p>

<hr>
<p>Why am I revisiting my notes from this conference six years later? I might be feeling a bit nostalgic for the seeing-people-in-person events a year into pandemic-induced isolation. I'm also in the middle of reading "Becoming a Technical Leader" by Jerry Weinberg. One of the questions asks you to read an autobiography of someone you admire. It turns out none of the people I shared TestBash NYC with have published autobiographies...yet. </p>

<h4>Check that you have time</h4>
<p>At my current job, everyone in the R&amp;D department gets a budget of two days per month to spend "crafting," or researching, building, testing, etc. what interests them. Most often people use this time to bring work they're passionate about up from the bottom of the backlog to be worked on now.</p>
<p>I was in the middle of adding a security scanning tool to our CI pipeline when I happened upon something interesting to test: a new web application. An old application that had been widely-used around the company, and as it turns out, with our customers too, had gone down. It allowed you to share a piece of text with a link. The text was only visible once. It wouldn't be viewable subsequent times you followed the link, so the application was good for sending passwords around securely. </p>
<p>The person who'd built the application had left the company. In inquiring about who/how we might maintain it now, one of the customer support leads mentioned in a public Slack channel that he'd built a replacement. "Great!" I thought. "This is the one day I have an hour to test it." I was waiting for code review feedback on my pipeline scan, so it was perfect timing.</p>
<h4>Check that the feedback will be heard</h4>
<p>It's a waste of time and energy (with the latter being in shorter supply these days) to test something if nobody's going to do anything with the results of your testing. More on that in <a href="https://elizabethzagroba.com/posts/2020/2020-05-24_if_a_test_falls_in_a_forest/">this post</a>. So I checked with the customer support person first. After taking a quick look at the new application and confirming that it seemed to work, but could use some tweaks, I asked the customer support person in a direct message if he was ready for usability and accessibility feedback. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: Hi there, I have a bit of usability and accessibility feedback about the secrets app. Is it at a stage where this feedback would be useful?</p>
<p>Him: Yes, definitely 🙂</p>
<p>Me: Great, I'll send you a Paper doc this afternoon.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Collect the feedback in the same way it will be presented, and present feedback in a way that the audience is comfortable with</h4>
<p>As much as I love making mindmaps, I decided that might not be the best format in this case. I doubted the customer support lead would bother to download a mind mapping application, company security restrictions prevented me from sharing a web-based one, and I'd probably want to walk him through a mind map I produced. But that felt like too much trouble for something small, plus I didn't want another Zoom call on a day otherwise free from them. </p>
<p>Instead, I used my company's go-to document tool of choice: Dropbox Paper. I might not enjoy it as much, but I knew it was a way he was used to receiving and collaborating asynchronously. I confirmed that format with him to be sure, and then I got to testing. </p>
<h4>Share your oracles (reasons why you have feedback)</h4>
<p>Once I opened a one-time link the application created, there was a page with an animated GIF, the piece of text that was shared, and a button to <code>Copy Value</code>. My immediate testing notes were something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove GIF/make it stop rotating</li>
<li>Move button to the top</li>
<li>Make font bigger</li>
</ul>
<p>This customer support lead might have just taken than feedback and made the changes. But since I don't have an existing relationship where I provide feedback about his work, and developing applications is not his normal line of work, I provided more details: </p>
<ul>
<li>Animated GIFs (that can't be turned off) can trigger people with epilepsy or motion disorders (vertigo for example). <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/designing/#provide-controls-for-content-that-starts-automatically">Here's the W3C guideline on this</a>. </li>
<li>Move the <code>Copy Value</code> button above the text you're sharing so it's visible even if the text is ~5000 characters long.</li>
<li>Increase the font size from the current 14px to 16px for vision-impaired peoeple. The ADA and typography geeks recommend 16, Apple has 17 as their font size. </li>
</ul>
<p>Now the customer support lead  understands why I'm asking for these changes. He can make different decisions than exactly what I've suggested while still addressing the problem I'm reporting. Plus he'll know more for next time he's building something. </p>
<h4>Acknowledge the limits of the situation</h4>
<p>Somewhat to my surprise, the customer support lead  started implementing my feedback right away! He took what I said into account, including removing the animated GIF entirely. He appreciated my feedback and wanted me to look at the application again the next day. Unfortunately, the next day was back to a regular work day filled with priorities, pressure, meetings, etc. I told him I wasn't going to have time to test it again. He went ahead and launched a functioning product. </p>
<h4>Move on</h4>
<p>While testing the product, another colleague noticed that the application had a larger architecture and setup than strictly what was needed for this particular use-case. Also, the application didn't provide an API for applications instead of humans to be sending around secret links to other humans. I defended the customer support lead: he was doing his best to solve his problem with the tools and skills he had. It wasn't the right time or place to come in at the end of a project that was about to provide value to people (myself included) and announce "this was not the optimal way to build this tool." You don't have to share all the feedback you collect. </p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The next time you're wondering if you should parachute in to test something new, consider these steps: </p>
<ul>
<li>check that you have time</li>
<li>check that the feedback will be heard</li>
<li>collect the feedback in the same way it will be presented</li>
<li>present feedback in a way that the audience is comfortable with</li>
<li>share your oracles (reasons why you have feedback)</li>
<li>acknowledge the limits of the situation</li>
<li>move on</li>
</ul>
